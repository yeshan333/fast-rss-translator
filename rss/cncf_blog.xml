      <description>【&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;We’d like to take a moment to welcome and introduce (or reintroduce) Bob Killen, CNCF’s new Senior Technical Program Manager! Bob has been a member of the cloud native community for some time now and is probably familiar to many of you for his work on Kubernetes and SIG Contributor Experience. We’re excited that he’s bringing that experience to CNCF to focus on improving project governance processes and finding engaging ways to bring end users and maintainers together.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;For those who aren’t already familiar, or those who are and want to hear it again, we’ve asked Bob to share his story and what he is most looking forward to in his new role within the cloud native community.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Can you give us a quick background of your work with Kubernetes and beyond?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure! It’s uhh… a bit of a long story though heh. It began in late 2013 when Jeefy (Jeff Sica, also a CNCF employee) and I were developing our own container scheduler using LXC, a sort of precursor to Docker, for our own use at the University of Michigan Hospital. We were attracted to it for all the same reasons folks are now, making it easy to package up and ship applications with a vetted stack, GREAT for both healthcare and research purposes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Docker came along, and we quickly pivoted to that. Then, not too long after things started to pick up with Mesos and Kubernetes. The container orchestration system we built was quite rudimentary compared to those two and we were ready to ditch our homegrown system for one of those.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We liked Kubernetes, jumped into the google-containers irc channel and started to give it a go. BUT as you can imagine, Kubernetes in the early days was not really ready for production use. So, we went with Mesos, and it worked well for us until we both left the hospital in 2016 for &lt;a href=&#34;https://arc.umich.edu/&#34;&gt;ARC&lt;/a&gt;, the Advanced Research Computing side of the University. It was there that we both dove back into Kubernetes HARD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We spun up and hosted several K8s clusters, all for Researcher self-service. ARC was traditionally a big HPC shop, but in 2017, more and more users were asking for apps, or like Jupyter Notebooks and K8s really lended itself for that. We built an entire research-oriented self-service platform where our users could spin up a catalog of research apps. They were happy, we were happy, and we got to do all sorts of fun experimental stuff like building science DMZs to filter 100gb traffic with eBPF, or running K8s on bare metal and attaching infiniband adapters to containers directly so they could do MPI. We were also encouraged to get out and give talks and, more importantly, TEACH people about this stuff. This is when I started to get more involved in the CNCF, and we convinced ARC to join as a Higher Ed institution, as well as trying to get others in Higher Ed engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was also during this that a local cloud native meetup started up, and at the first meeting, we knew we had found our people *laughs*. Jorge Castro, yet another current CNCF employee, was there, and he basically pushed us over the edge from being engaged users consuming Kubernetes, to actually getting much more involved upstream…and things kind of took off from there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I still remember attending KubeCon North America 2017 and Jorge dragging me to the Kubernetes Contributor Summit. I didn’t think I should be there because I wasn’t an org member yet, but he basically handed me a contributor t-shirt and started introducing me to folks – Paris Pittman, Josh Berkus, Aaron Crickenberger, Tim Hockin, Paul Morie, and a whole slew of others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long before I started regularly contributing in SIG Contributor Experience, and getting much more involved in K8s and the greater ecosystem. Since Jeff and I were both heavily on the research side, we wound up chatting with Ricardo Rocha from CERN and going out there to talk about what we can do to advance the field, bring High Throughput Computing (HTC) and batch more to the cloud native world. This was around the same time that I helped kick off the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cncf/research-user-group&#34;&gt;CNCF Research User Group &lt;/a&gt;to tackle these same issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fast forward to the end of 2019, a bunch of releases and contributor summits later, Paris nominated me to take her place as chair of ContribEx. I was nervous &amp;amp; flattered and happily accepted…BUT…didn’t think I’d be starting off in hard mode with COVID right around the corner. Jorge stepped up as co-chair to help, but man, it was still difficult. I actually have some stats from that time that I shared in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2021/05/keynote-shaping-kubernetes-community-culture/&#34;&gt;2021 KubeCon EU Keynote&lt;/a&gt;. COVID caused a 15% drop in maintainer activity across all the K8s orgs and a 24% drop in the main Kubernetes repo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;COVID was a blur – it felt both extremely long and short at the same time. I was elected to Kubernetes Steering, joined Google’s OSPO as a Senior OSS Program Manager, and made the transition from a part time hobby contributor to actually paid to work in OSS. It’s the dream right? I got to work with a LOT more projects outside of K8s helping build their strategies. It was great and stressful at the same time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During all this I helped K8s navigate several big challenges, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/02/17/dockershim-faq/&#34;&gt;dockershim&lt;/a&gt;, launching &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kubernetes.dev/&#34;&gt;kubernetes.dev&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/03/10/image-registry-redirect/&#34;&gt;registry redirect&lt;/a&gt;. Helped push through several governance changes aimed at making the project more sustainable. There’s a lot more, but those are probably the big ones in terms of “events”. HOWEVER, the thing I am most proud of is the people I helped mentor who have grown into their own leadership positions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kaslin&#34;&gt;Kaslin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/palnabarun&#34;&gt;Nabarun&lt;/a&gt; were both part of our ContribEx leads mentor cohort aimed at essentially mentoring our replacements (Chairs &amp;amp; Tech Leads), and I’m proud to say they have both become excellent leaders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here we are now, they’re both successful leads, and I serve alongside Nabarun on Steering. I think thats the real legacy 🙂 The people legacy is the thing I’m proud of.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Soo..uhh, sorry that wound up being much longer than I thought it would be – but that’s kinda the TL;DR backstory of how I got to where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;What made you want to join CNCF, and why now?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked closely with CNCF in one capacity or another since 2017 so it hasn’t felt like a huge transition. *laughs* That is the wonderful thing about open source – jobs change, but the people are still around. I wanted to join CNCF to honestly help the friends I’ve made and the greater community at large be sustainable. I know far too many people who have burned out because they’re willing to put in more hours than they should to keep what they care about going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The root of it is there is A LOT of unrealized value in these projects. It’s just not surfaced or communicated well enough to get the attention it needs from both vendors and end users. I can rant on on this subject for quite a while, but if you don’t mind a shameless plug – I talk about it at length in a talk I did at KubeCon Paris: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2024/03/why-is-this-so-hard-conveying-the-business-value-of-open-source/&#34;&gt;Why is this so HARD?! Conveying the Business Value of Open Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also…it’s great to get the team back together again—or, as Jorge so lovingly calls it, the “Pod.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image size-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34; width=&#34;326&#34; height=&#34;174&#34; src=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Picture-1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Gif - &#39;We&#39;re. putting the band back together&#39;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-114707&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;What are you most looking forward to achieving with the cloud native community? Any challenges you foresee?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Creating ways to surface that unrealized value in the projects. I have a variety of ideas that could help create better incentives for participating and actually being able to track the impact of individuals’ &amp;amp; companies’ work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m also a crazy process optimization person that loves to help simplify and streamline things. Thinking especially around projects changing levels. A good example is all the work going into DTR (Domain Technical Reviews)&amp;nbsp; being led by Karena Angel. It SHOULD dramatically reduce the tasks that are blocking on a TOC or TAG member.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as challenges go…mostly time. *laughs* there’s ALWAYS more to do and not enough time. Sorry, that’s kind of a cop-out answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;What are some of the most exciting trends in cloud native that you see taking off over the next few years?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI!..joking…sort of. There are less “exciting” or directly noticeable things being developed to enable AI that I think will have a FAR reaching impact beyond AI workloads. We are seeing additional scheduling options with things like &lt;a href=&#34;https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/&#34;&gt;Kueue&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://volcano.sh/en/&#34;&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt;. There’s more work going into the underlying K8s to make it more scalable and performant, not to mention &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/12/15/dynamic-resource-allocation/&#34;&gt;DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation)&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to A LOT more possibilities with hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’re also seeing more development for multi-cluster management &amp;amp; scheduling, mostly for AI/ML type workloads to burst where there’s hardware available like &lt;a href=&#34;https://karmada.io/&#34;&gt;Karmada&lt;/a&gt;, BUT that same functionality makes it dramatically easier for users to manage general workloads across clusters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I think the efforts being put into enabling better AI/ML workloads will actually have a greater long term impact on the general usage patterns of K8s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Anything else you want to share with the community?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How bout my best tips for getting started with contributing? I had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/MrBobbyTables/status/1678823563527090185&#34;&gt;tweet thread&lt;/a&gt; last year that explored this a bit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People are much more willing to help you if you demonstrate that you’ve spent time looking at the project first; show you’ve made SOME investment first..like did you look at the contributor guide and the other basics. Maintainers are already strapped for time and There’s a big difference between “Hey, I want to contribute” vs. “I’ve read the contributor guide and got my environment setup. I’ve found an &amp;lt;issue&amp;gt;, but have a few questions about how &amp;lt;thing&amp;gt; works, can anyone help?” That sort of dovetails into my 2nd tip.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Start with a thing you KNOW, or have a good idea you can do. If you can, pick something you’re passionate about. Flex your experience. I have had dozens of people reach out to me about taking on an issue or getting involved in the most complex and difficult parts of the project without understanding the fundamentals of the project. It just&amp;nbsp; leads to a lot of frustration from both you and the maintainer(s) that you engage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take the time to learn the basics of git. You will have a MUCH better time if you are familiar with general PR based workflow, branching, squashing and rebasing. You don’t have to be able to do them without looking up a reference, but know what they are and when they should be used.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you open a PR, give it a little time before asking for reviews. Some projects have weekly triage meetings where they go through all open PRs. MANY projects are global and span multiple time zones, not to mention there’s still a good chunk of folk that don’t or can’t work on it during working hours. Now, it shouldn’t linger open forever, but take a look at some of the other PRs and get an idea of the general time it takes folks to respond before you start pinging people. The maintainers will appreciate it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few others in that tweet thread, but it really boils down to being intentional. If you show that you are invested and committed and do your research before getting engaged, you will have a much better time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trust me, maintainers WANT new people to come in and start contributing, and most importantly grow into maintainers. Maintainers will SERIOUSLY bend over backward to help or mentor those who show that kind of intentionality and commitment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;##&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please help us extend a big thank you and welcome to Bob!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to reach out to him to say hello, share ideas for improving the contributor experience, or just have a chat, you can find him on:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;X: @&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MrBobbyTables&#34;&gt;MrBobbyTables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Email: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:bkillen@linuxfoundation.org&#34;&gt;bkillen@linuxfoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;GitHub: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mrbobbytables&#34;&gt;mrbobbytables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrbobbytables/&#34;&gt;@mrbobbytables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Or &lt;a href=&#34;https://slack.cncf.io/?_gl=1*1iltrza*_gcl_au*MTYxMzUzODg3Mi4xNzE5MzM3ODUx*_ga*MTM1NjkxOTkzOS4xNjA2NzQ3OTQy*_ga_VWZ4V8CGRF*MTcyMTQwOTIwMC4xMy4xLjE3MjE0MDk2MDUuMC4wLjA.&#34;&gt;CNCF Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;】&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;We’d like to take a moment to welcome and introduce (or reintroduce) Bob Killen, CNCF’s new Senior Technical Program Manager!

We are seeing additional scheduling options with things like &lt;a href=&#34;https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/&#34;&gt;Kueue&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://volcano.sh/en/&#34;&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt;. There’s more work going into the underlying K8s to make it more scalable and performant, not to mention &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/12/15/dynamic-resource-allocation/&#34;&gt;DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation)&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to A LOT more possibilities with hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’re also seeing more development for multi-cluster management &amp;amp; scheduling, mostly for AI/ML type workloads to burst where there’s hardware available like &lt;a href=&#34;https://karmada.io/&#34;&gt;Karmada&lt;/a&gt;, BUT that same functionality makes it dramatically easier for users to manage general workloads across clusters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I think the efforts being put into enabling better AI/ML workloads will actually have a greater long term impact on the general usage patterns of K8s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Anything else you want to share with the community?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How bout my best tips for getting started with contributing? I had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/MrBobbyTables/status/1678823563527090185&#34;&gt;tweet thread&lt;/a&gt; last year that explored this a bit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People are much more willing to help you if you demonstrate that you’ve spent time looking at the project first; show you’ve made SOME investment first..like did you look at the contributor guide and the other basics. Maintainers are already strapped for time and There’s a big difference between “Hey, I want to contribute” vs. “I’ve read the contributor guide and got my environment setup. I’ve found an &amp;lt;issue&amp;gt;, but have a few questions about how &amp;lt;thing&amp;gt; works, can anyone help?” That sort of dovetails into my 2nd tip.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Start with a thing you KNOW, or have a good idea you can do. If you can, pick something you’re passionate about. Flex your experience. I have had dozens of people reach out to me about taking on an issue or getting involved in the most complex and difficult parts of the project without understanding the fundamentals of the project. It just&amp;nbsp; leads to a lot of frustration from both you and the maintainer(s) that you engage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take the time to learn the basics of git. You will have a MUCH better time if you are familiar with general PR based workflow, branching, squashing and rebasing. You don’t have to be able to do them without looking up a reference, but know what they are and when they should be used.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you open a PR, give it a little time before asking for reviews. Some projects have weekly triage meetings where they go through all open PRs. MANY projects are global and span multiple time zones, not to mention there’s still a good chunk of folk that don’t or can’t work on it during working hours. Now, it shouldn’t linger open forever, but take a look at some of the other PRs and get an idea of the general time it takes folks to respond before you start pinging people. The maintainers will appreciate it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few others in that tweet thread, but it really boils down to being intentional. If you show that you are invested and committed and do your research before getting engaged, you will have a much better time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trust me, maintainers WANT new people to come in and start contributing, and most importantly grow into maintainers. Maintainers will SERIOUSLY bend over backward to help or mentor those who show that kind of intentionality and commitment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;##&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please help us extend a big thank you and welcome to Bob!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to reach out to him to say hello, share ideas for improving the contributor experience, or just have a chat, you can find him on:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;X: @&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MrBobbyTables&#34;&gt;MrBobbyTables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Email: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:bkillen@linuxfoundation.org&#34;&gt;bkillen@linuxfoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;GitHub: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mrbobbytables&#34;&gt;mrbobbytables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrbobbytables/&#34;&gt;@mrbobbytables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Or &lt;a href=&#34;https://slack.cncf.io/?_gl=1*1iltrza*_gcl_au*MTYxMzUzODg3Mi4xNzE5MzM3ODUx*_ga*MTM1NjkxOTkzOS4xNjA2NzQ3OTQy*_ga_VWZ4V8CGRF*MTcyMTQwOTIwMC4xMy4xLjE3MjE0MDk2MDUuMC4wLjA.&#34;&gt;CNCF Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>【Organising the first KCD Hyderabad – my amazing experience】组织第一届 KCD 海得拉巴——我的奇妙经历</title>
      <link>https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/07/15/organising-the-first-kcd-hyderabad-my-amazing-experience/</link>
      <description>【&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;KCD post originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://socialmaharaj.com/2024/06/29/first-kcd-hyderabad-experience/&#34;&gt;Social Maharaj &lt;/a&gt;by Atulpriya Sharma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being a food and travel blogger, I often attend a lot of food meet-ups where I get to experience different dishes and meet new people as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;But did you know there are a lot of tech events too?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yes, if you asked me a couple of years ago, I would have stared at you like a wall. But today, things are different.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the cloud native landscape, there are a lot of local, regional, national and international conferences and meet-ups that are organised. Locally, we have&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://community.cncf.io/hyderabad/&#34;&gt;CNCF Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;meet-ups that I organise monthly, regionally there are bigger conferences like&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes Community Days (KCDs)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;that happen at the city level KCD Bengaluru, KCD Chennai, KCD Hyderabad etc., nationally there are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;KubeDay&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;events&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;(the last one in India was in Bengaluru last year)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and international ones are KubeCon. Fortunately, I got to attend&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://socialmaharaj.com/2023/11/21/my-kubecon-chicago-2023-experience/&#34;&gt;KubeCon Chicago&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://socialmaharaj.com/2024/04/06/kubecon-paris-2024-experience/&#34;&gt;KubeCon Paris&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of years that I’ve been in the cloud native space, I’ve attended and spoken at a lot of meet-ups and conferences be it KubeCon or KCDs. But I was never on the organising side of things. However, over the last 6 months or so I have been busy with a couple of other folks to organise Hyderabad’s First KCD event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image size-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; src=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Atulpriya giving a talk&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-114131&#34; srcset=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3.jpg 1024w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3-900x506.jpg 900w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3-356x200.jpg 356w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3-711x400.jpg 711w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We concluded that on June 22nd, so you can get a glimpse of what happened by browsing through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/KCDHyderabad?src=hashtag_click&#34;&gt;#KCDHyderabad&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;hashtag.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I’ll talk about my experience of organising the first KCD Hyderabad, things that I learnt, processes and mistakes that I made.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing for KCD Hyderabad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every year,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;we can host only 3 KCDs in India&lt;/strong&gt;, so the first one was in Kochi followed by Pune and finally ending the year with KCD Hyderabad. I was a speaker at KCD Kerala and KCD Pune and one of the organisers for KCD Hyderabad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It all started way back in May 2023 when some of our community members reached out asking if we would ever have a KCD Hyderabad and Hyderabad becoming one of the tech hubs in the country, we thought we must plan and have one. So a GitHub issue was raised in May 2023 and what followed was weekly calls with other interested organisers to prepare, plan and execute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finalising the Date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;June 22, was the date that was reserved for KCD Hyderabad. Internally we spent a week or so to figure out the perfect date considering the holidays, schools, festivals etc. to ensure we reach the maximum people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, the next question was whether we wanted to do it as a multiple-day conference with multiple rooms or a single-day event. Since this was the first time we were doing it, we tried to keep it to one day only.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another big ticket item is the venue. Most other KCDs in India took place at star hotels and convention centres. Being part of the F&amp;amp;B industry, I had connections at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://socialmaharaj.com/2021/08/04/staycation-in-hyderabad-novotel-hicc/&#34;&gt;Novotel HICC&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://socialmaharaj.com/2021/10/16/turquoise-le-meridien-hyderabad-review/&#34;&gt;Le Meridien&lt;/a&gt;’s and other similar hotels. However, even with the connections and discounts, the amount that was quoted was way too much. So we decided to not go for such properties and instead look for smaller venues that weren’t too costly but also could accommodate a decent crowd.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQpM2j9XYAE-3z8?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=large&#34; alt=&#34;T-Hub - venue for KCD Hyderabad&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually after scouting for places, we settled for&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;T-Hub&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;opposite Ikea. It’s among the largest incubators in the world and is home to a lot of start-ups. They have multiple spaces that they rent out for events. I had attended meet-ups at T-Hub in the past, so was aware of the space. We eventually decided to go with the two rooms in T-Hub that would accommodate 400-430 people.&amp;nbsp; With this, we were now clear on the number of people we could allow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, we had to look for sponsors who would sponsor the conference. This is a totally new experience for me. We were reaching out to folks on LinkedIn, Twitter, Email and all other mediums to reach out to folks who might be interested in sponsoring the event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily we found quite a few folks who were interested in sponsoring the event. By the time we were close to the event day, we had to stop taking sponsorships – not because we didn’t need the money but because we couldn’t fulfil the requirements due to logistical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers and Agenda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most important parts of a tech conference are the speakers and the agenda. People attend conferences to learn and network and that meant we had to carefully choose the speakers and experts that were going to attend KCD Hyderabad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We opened the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Call For Proposals (CFPs)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;a few months before the event and to our surprise, we had 180 topics that were submitted by over 100 unique speakers. To give you a context, for a single-day event, considering 20 mins for each talk and multiple breaks, we can at max accommodate 10-12 talks.&amp;nbsp;Further, we also had&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Jayesh Ranjan, IAS&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;who was the chief guest for the event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQqsxcEXAAALSG3?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=medium&#34; alt=&#34;Jayesh Ranjan, IAS - Chief Guest at KCD Hyderabad&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With 180 talks, it was a herculean task to review all of them. So I reached out to a few experts in the community to help us review the CPFs and they also took a week to finalise the top talks. With the talks finalised, we had to publish the agenda and inform all the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But guess what? Not all selected speakers respond or can join the event, so we need to have backup speakers as well. Quite a task this was.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another crucial part of any conference is swags and food. Swags are things that the attendees get when they attend a conference. Since KCD Hyderabad like others was a paid event, we had to give them something. So we spent a few weeks figuring out what we could give them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQGpCw4llMs3Eg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1719062626637?e=1722470400&amp;amp;v=beta&amp;amp;t=Jmv_egcrrhfuzMcKNtMDZ171IwE-0xwGrrtKlFHHBf4&#34; alt=&#34;KCD Hyderabad Swags&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we settled for a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;customised T-shirt, an umbrella, a tote bag&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;laptop stickers&lt;/strong&gt;. To add to this, we additionally gave a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3XGbBbV&#34;&gt;Logitech K480 keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to all our speakers and a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Portronics Freedom Wireless Charger&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to all the volunteers. Finalising the items was easy, but customising them was a task. I remember visiting local vendors to check the quality of T-shirts, bags and everything else.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Food is another critical thing. Since we were expecting around 400 people with a lot of people coming from outside of Hyderabad, I was adamant about having a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;good Biryani for lunch&lt;/strong&gt;. Further, being the Maharaj, I had to ensure we gave the attendees a taste of Hyderabad. Again, I hunted for eateries and caterers who could give me that experience without burning a hole in my pocket.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent a couple of weekends, just visiting restaurants and caterers to finalise them. Eventually, we stuck with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Deccan Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;, a popular restaurant and caterer in Hyderabad and I guess we did a good job when it came to food. People loved the food and Biryani especially, so I was relieved.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So these were some of the major elements that we had to look at while organising the first KCD in Hyderabad. Over the last 6 months or so, we split our responsibilities to focus on things that we’re good at and started working towards it. Hundreds of Google meets and calls, in-person meets and eventually, KCD Hyderabad was a success! With over&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;400 people in attendance from across the globe&lt;/strong&gt;, it was quite an event.&amp;nbsp; You can get a glimpse of what happened by browsing through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/KCDHyderabad?src=hashtag_click&#34;&gt;#KCDHyderabad&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;hashtag.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as they say, there’s learning in everything. Organising an event of a scale of KCD isn’t easy. There are so many things and people involved that you need to ensure that everything is well-planned and executed smoothly. Here are my 5 key learnings after organizing KCD Hyderabad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Key Learnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning and preparation are crucial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I learned that thorough planning is essential. We started preparing months in advance, from choosing the date to finding the right venue. We had to consider holidays, school schedules, and festivals to maximize attendance. Every detail, from deciding on a single-day event to selecting the venue, required careful thought and discussion among organizers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;things don’t work as planned&lt;/strong&gt;. From spending the entire night at the venue to ensure the event setup was done, to only realising that even on the day of the event we were still not complete. So, always be prepared for eventualities, they will come from nowhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget management is a balancing act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Managing the budget was challenging. We had to make smart choices to keep costs down without compromising on quality. For example, instead of expensive hotels, we chose T-Hub, which was more affordable but still accommodated our needs. We also had to be creative with sponsorships, reaching out through various channels to secure funding while&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;being careful not to over-commit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content curation is both exciting and challenging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Selecting speakers and creating the agenda was one of the most crucial and difficult tasks. We received 180 talk proposals for only 10-12 available slots. It took a team of experts to review and select the best ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I learned that it’s important to have backup speakers too, as not all selected speakers can always make it. Further, with most sponsors wanting a slot to speak, it’s difficult to maintain the balance of community vs sponsored talks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention to attendee experience pays off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realized how important it is to focus on the attendee experience. This included carefully choosing swag items like customized T-shirts, umbrellas, and laptop stickers. We also put a lot of effort into selecting good food, especially ensuring we had great biryani to showcase Hyderabad’s cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The positive feedback on these aspects was really rewarding. Sure there were a few niggles where some people told the queues were too long and things like that, but overall people were quite satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork and delegation are key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organizing an event of this scale taught me the importance of teamwork and delegation. Over six months, we divided responsibilities based on our strengths. It involved countless meetings, calls, and in-person discussions. I learned that success depends on everyone working together and focusing on their specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also looked out for volunteers who could help. A handful of them did turn up eventually and took care of a lot of things on D-day. I felt, we could have leveraged their support a little earlier in the preparation cycle as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Is The Next KCD Hyderabad?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on our successful first KCD Hyderabad, we’ve learned valuable lessons about thorough planning, budget management, content curation, attendee experience, and teamwork. These insights will be crucial for future organizers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the next KCD Hyderabad, while I’d love to announce a date, it’s not that simple. With only 3 KCDs allowed annually in India, we rotate between cities to reach different communities. Having said that, I’m optimistic about its return given the fantastic response.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, stay connected with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://community.cncf.io/hyderabad/&#34;&gt;CNCF Hyderabad community&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and watch for KCDs in other Indian cities. Thank you to everyone who made our inaugural event special. When KCD Hyderabad returns, we’ll apply these learnings to make it even better.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s it for this blog post.

But today, things are different.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the cloud native landscape, there are a lot of local, regional, national and international conferences and meet-ups that are organised. Locally, we have&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://community.cncf.io/hyderabad/&#34;&gt;CNCF Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;meet-ups that I organise monthly, regionally there are bigger conferences like&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes Community Days (KCDs)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;that happen at the city level KCD Bengaluru, KCD Chennai, KCD Hyderabad etc., nationally there are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;KubeDay&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;events&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;(the last one in India was in Bengaluru last year)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and international ones are KubeCon. Fortunately, I got to attend&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://socialmaharaj.com/2023/11/21/my-kubecon-chicago-2023-experience/&#34;&gt;KubeCon Chicago&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://socialmaharaj.com/2024/04/06/kubecon-paris-2024-experience/&#34;&gt;KubeCon Paris&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of years that I’ve been in the cloud native space, I’ve attended and spoken at a lot of meet-ups and conferences be it KubeCon or KCDs. But I was never on the organising side of things. However, over the last 6 months or so I have been busy with a couple of other folks to organise Hyderabad’s First KCD event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image size-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; src=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Atulpriya giving a talk&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-114131&#34; srcset=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3.jpg 1024w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3-900x506.jpg 900w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3-356x200.jpg 356w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6-3-711x400.jpg 711w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We concluded that on June 22nd, so you can get a glimpse of what happened by browsing through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/KCDHyderabad?src=hashtag_click&#34;&gt;#KCDHyderabad&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;hashtag.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I’ll talk about my experience of organising the first KCD Hyderabad, things that I learnt, processes and mistakes that I made.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing for KCD Hyderabad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every year,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;we can host only 3 KCDs in India&lt;/strong&gt;, so the first one was in Kochi followed by Pune and finally ending the year with KCD Hyderabad. I was a speaker at KCD Kerala and KCD Pune and one of the organisers for KCD Hyderabad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It all started way back in May 2023 when some of our community members reached out asking if we would ever have a KCD Hyderabad and Hyderabad becoming one of the tech hubs in the country, we thought we must plan and have one. So a GitHub issue was raised in May 2023 and what followed was weekly calls with other interested organisers to prepare, plan and execute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finalising the Date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;June 22, was the date that was reserved for KCD Hyderabad. Internally we spent a week or so to figure out the perfect date considering the holidays, schools, festivals etc. to ensure we reach the maximum people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, the next question was whether we wanted to do it as a multiple-day conference with multiple rooms or a single-day event. Since this was the first time we were doing it, we tried to keep it to one day only.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another big ticket item is the venue. Most other KCDs in India took place at star hotels and convention centres. Being part of the F&amp;amp;B industry, I had connections at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://socialmaharaj.com/2021/08/04/staycation-in-hyderabad-novotel-hicc/&#34;&gt;Novotel HICC&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://socialmaharaj.com/2021/10/16/turquoise-le-meridien-hyderabad-review/&#34;&gt;Le Meridien&lt;/a&gt;’s and other similar hotels. However, even with the connections and discounts, the amount that was quoted was way too much. So we decided to not go for such properties and instead look for smaller venues that weren’t too costly but also could accommodate a decent crowd.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQpM2j9XYAE-3z8?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=large&#34; alt=&#34;T-Hub - venue for KCD Hyderabad&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually after scouting for places, we settled for&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;T-Hub&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;opposite Ikea. It’s among the largest incubators in the world and is home to a lot of start-ups. They have multiple spaces that they rent out for events. I had attended meet-ups at T-Hub in the past, so was aware of the space. We eventually decided to go with the two rooms in T-Hub that would accommodate 400-430 people.&amp;nbsp; With this, we were now clear on the number of people we could allow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, we had to look for sponsors who would sponsor the conference. This is a totally new experience for me. We were reaching out to folks on LinkedIn, Twitter, Email and all other mediums to reach out to folks who might be interested in sponsoring the event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily we found quite a few folks who were interested in sponsoring the event. By the time we were close to the event day, we had to stop taking sponsorships – not because we didn’t need the money but because we couldn’t fulfil the requirements due to logistical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers and Agenda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most important parts of a tech conference are the speakers and the agenda. People attend conferences to learn and network and that meant we had to carefully choose the speakers and experts that were going to attend KCD Hyderabad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We opened the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Call For Proposals (CFPs)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;a few months before the event and to our surprise, we had 180 topics that were submitted by over 100 unique speakers. To give you a context, for a single-day event, considering 20 mins for each talk and multiple breaks, we can at max accommodate 10-12 talks.&amp;nbsp;Further, we also had&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Jayesh Ranjan, IAS&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;who was the chief guest for the event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQqsxcEXAAALSG3?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=medium&#34; alt=&#34;Jayesh Ranjan, IAS - Chief Guest at KCD Hyderabad&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With 180 talks, it was a herculean task to review all of them. So I reached out to a few experts in the community to help us review the CPFs and they also took a week to finalise the top talks. With the talks finalised, we had to publish the agenda and inform all the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But guess what? Not all selected speakers respond or can join the event, so we need to have backup speakers as well. Quite a task this was.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another crucial part of any conference is swags and food. Swags are things that the attendees get when they attend a conference. Since KCD Hyderabad like others was a paid event, we had to give them something. So we spent a few weeks figuring out what we could give them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQGpCw4llMs3Eg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1719062626637?e=1722470400&amp;amp;v=beta&amp;amp;t=Jmv_egcrrhfuzMcKNtMDZ171IwE-0xwGrrtKlFHHBf4&#34; alt=&#34;KCD Hyderabad Swags&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we settled for a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;customised T-shirt, an umbrella, a tote bag&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;laptop stickers&lt;/strong&gt;. To add to this, we additionally gave a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3XGbBbV&#34;&gt;Logitech K480 keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to all our speakers and a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Portronics Freedom Wireless Charger&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to all the volunteers. Finalising the items was easy, but customising them was a task. I remember visiting local vendors to check the quality of T-shirts, bags and everything else.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Food is another critical thing. Since we were expecting around 400 people with a lot of people coming from outside of Hyderabad, I was adamant about having a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;good Biryani for lunch&lt;/strong&gt;. Further, being the Maharaj, I had to ensure we gave the attendees a taste of Hyderabad. Again, I hunted for eateries and caterers who could give me that experience without burning a hole in my pocket.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent a couple of weekends, just visiting restaurants and caterers to finalise them. Eventually, we stuck with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Deccan Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;, a popular restaurant and caterer in Hyderabad and I guess we did a good job when it came to food. People loved the food and Biryani especially, so I was relieved.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So these were some of the major elements that we had to look at while organising the first KCD in Hyderabad. Over the last 6 months or so, we split our responsibilities to focus on things that we’re good at and started working towards it. Hundreds of Google meets and calls, in-person meets and eventually, KCD Hyderabad was a success! With over&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;400 people in attendance from across the globe&lt;/strong&gt;, it was quite an event.&amp;nbsp; You can get a glimpse of what happened by browsing through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/KCDHyderabad?src=hashtag_click&#34;&gt;#KCDHyderabad&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;hashtag.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as they say, there’s learning in everything. Organising an event of a scale of KCD isn’t easy. There are so many things and people involved that you need to ensure that everything is well-planned and executed smoothly. Here are my 5 key learnings after organizing KCD Hyderabad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Key Learnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning and preparation are crucial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I learned that thorough planning is essential. We started preparing months in advance, from choosing the date to finding the right venue. We had to consider holidays, school schedules, and festivals to maximize attendance. Every detail, from deciding on a single-day event to selecting the venue, required careful thought and discussion among organizers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;things don’t work as planned&lt;/strong&gt;. From spending the entire night at the venue to ensure the event setup was done, to only realising that even on the day of the event we were still not complete. So, always be prepared for eventualities, they will come from nowhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget management is a balancing act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Managing the budget was challenging. We had to make smart choices to keep costs down without compromising on quality. For example, instead of expensive hotels, we chose T-Hub, which was more affordable but still accommodated our needs. We also had to be creative with sponsorships, reaching out through various channels to secure funding while&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;being careful not to over-commit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content curation is both exciting and challenging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Selecting speakers and creating the agenda was one of the most crucial and difficult tasks. We received 180 talk proposals for only 10-12 available slots. It took a team of experts to review and select the best ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I learned that it’s important to have backup speakers too, as not all selected speakers can always make it. Further, with most sponsors wanting a slot to speak, it’s difficult to maintain the balance of community vs sponsored talks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention to attendee experience pays off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realized how important it is to focus on the attendee experience. This included carefully choosing swag items like customized T-shirts, umbrellas, and laptop stickers. We also put a lot of effort into selecting good food, especially ensuring we had great biryani to showcase Hyderabad’s cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The positive feedback on these aspects was really rewarding. Sure there were a few niggles where some people told the queues were too long and things like that, but overall people were quite satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork and delegation are key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organizing an event of this scale taught me the importance of teamwork and delegation. Over six months, we divided responsibilities based on our strengths. It involved countless meetings, calls, and in-person discussions. I learned that success depends on everyone working together and focusing on their specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also looked out for volunteers who could help. A handful of them did turn up eventually and took care of a lot of things on D-day. I felt, we could have leveraged their support a little earlier in the preparation cycle as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Is The Next KCD Hyderabad?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on our successful first KCD Hyderabad, we’ve learned valuable lessons about thorough planning, budget management, content curation, attendee experience, and teamwork. These insights will be crucial for future organizers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the next KCD Hyderabad, while I’d love to announce a date, it’s not that simple. With only 3 KCDs allowed annually in India, we rotate between cities to reach different communities. Having said that, I’m optimistic about its return given the fantastic response.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, stay connected with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://community.cncf.io/hyderabad/&#34;&gt;CNCF Hyderabad community&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and watch for KCDs in other Indian cities. Thank you to everyone who made our inaugural event special. When KCD Hyderabad returns, we’ll apply these learnings to make it even better.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s it for this blog post.

      <title>【Unlocking the power of ephemeral environments with Devtron】使用 Devtron 释放短暂环境的力量</title>
      <link>https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/07/12/unlocking-the-power-of-ephemeral-environments-with-devtron/</link>
      <description>【&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Member post originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://devtron.ai/blog/unlocking-the-power-of-ephemeral-environments-with-devtron/&#34;&gt;Devtron’s blog&lt;/a&gt; by Abhinav Dubey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: The blog talks about how ephemeral environments with Devtron become much easier, reducing the complexities, automating the process, and optimizing infra cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the world of software development,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ephemeral environments&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are temporary setups that serve specific purposes, such as testing or staging new features. These environments are short-lived, designed to exist only for the duration of their use case—like testing a feature branch—before being dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ephemeral environments contrast with traditional static environments, which are permanent and can lead to inefficiencies, especially when underutilized. They offer a dynamic approach, allowing developers to create an isolated environment on demand without affecting the main codebase or other ongoing development activities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;the-technical-and-business-value-of-ephemeral-environments&#34;&gt;The Technical and Business Value of Ephemeral Environments&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ephemeral environments provide significant advantages in different sectors as mentioned below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;: By creating environments only when needed and tearing them down afterward, organizations avoid the cost of maintaining idle resources. This is particularly beneficial for companies where lower-end environments such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dev-env&lt;/code&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;non-prod&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;can cost up to five times more than production environments.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agility and Speed&lt;/strong&gt;: Developers can quickly spin up environments to test new features or bug fixes without waiting for access to a shared environment. This agility accelerates development cycles and time-to-market.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;: Testing in isolated environments ensures that unstable code does not affect the rest of the system, reducing the risk of bugs in production.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;is-an-ephemeral-environment-right-for-you&#34;&gt;Is an Ephemeral Environment Right for You?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deciding whether ephemeral environments are suitable for your organization involves considering your development needs and organizational goals. Key questions include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do your development teams frequently need isolated environments for testing?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are you looking to optimize costs associated with non-production environments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is there a need to increase deployment speed and reduce risk in production?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you answered “yes” to any of these, ephemeral environments could be highly beneficial for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;traditional-approach-to-ephemeral-environment&#34;&gt;Traditional Approach to Ephemeral Environment&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ephemeral environment as mentioned above are the short lived environments, created and destroyed once the task is completed. We can create our scripts maybe in Terraform or Ansible or in python/shell to spin up a complete new environment that can be your VM Machines or Kubernetes clusters. Even though the automation can be achieved, there are few disadvantages associated with this approach, that include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay in Releases:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The time taken to bring up the entire infrastructure can lead to delays in testing features or conducting sanity checks for bug fixes, resulting in a longer time to market.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Complexity:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Creating and maintaining scripts to standardize environments across different stages can be complex and error-prone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Interventions:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Even with automation scripts, manual interventions are often required to configure and install dependencies based on the application’s specific requirements, adding to the setup time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DevOps Dependencies:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Developers typically lack expertise in tools like Terraform or Ansible, making them dependent on DevOps or SRE teams to make changes and install dependencies for their applications, which can slow down the development process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Management:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Managing the lifecycle of ephemeral environments can be challenging. These environments need to be deleted once tasks are completed; otherwise, they lead to resource wastage and increased costs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Infra Cost:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The costs associated with spinning up and maintaining ephemeral environments, particularly in cloud-based setups, can add significantly to the overall infrastructure expenses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;rethinking-ephemeral-environments&#34;&gt;Rethinking Ephemeral Environments&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we talk in terms of Kubernetes, setting up Ephemeral Environments becomes a lot easier than the traditional approach. Kubernetes has a beautiful thing called namespaces, a logical separation of group of resources, providing isolation of workloads within the same cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By leveraging namespaces and some advanced autoscaling methods, it becomes much more easier to create a ephemeral environment that is cost-effective, less complex and helps you dynamically bring up the resources and hibernate when not in use. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;how-to-set-up-an-ephemeral-environment-in-k8s-manually&#34;&gt;How to Set Up an Ephemeral Environment in K8s Manually?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Setting up an ephemeral environment, especially within a Kubernetes ecosystem, involves several key steps that ensure agility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Below, we detail a straightforward approach to creating and managing these temporary environments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Define Your Infrastructure Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before you create an ephemeral environment, it’s essential to understand the specific requirements of the application or feature being tested. This includes the necessary computing resources, the required services, and any dependencies that need to be replicated from the production environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Automate the Environment Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Automation is crucial in managing ephemeral environments to ensure they can be spun up and torn down efficiently. Tools like Terraform or Ansible can be used to script the creation of your infrastructure. In Kubernetes, you might automate setting up namespaces, deploying container images, and configuring network policies through CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Kubernetes Namespaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Kubernetes, namespaces provide a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users. Each ephemeral environment can be created in its namespace, isolating its running processes and resources from other environments&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;kubectl create namespace your-environment-name&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Deploy Your Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the namespace is ready, deploy your application using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts. This step often involves setting up the necessary config maps and secrets to configure the application according to the environment&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;kubectl apply -f your-application-deployment.yaml -n your-environment-name&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or using Helm&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;helm install your-application-release your-helm-chart/ -n your-environment-name&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Configure Autoscaling and Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;To optimize costs and resource usage, configure autoscaling for your application workloads. Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) or a more advanced tool like KEDA can be used to automatically adjust the number of pods based on traffic or other metrics&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code lang=&#34;javascript&#34; class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2&#xA;kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler&#xA;metadata:&#xA;  name: your-application-hpa&#xA;  namespace: your-environment-name&#xA;spec:&#xA;  scaleTargetRef:&#xA;    apiVersion: apps/v1&#xA;    kind: Deployment&#xA;    name: your-application-deployment&#xA;  minReplicas: 1&#xA;  maxReplicas: 10&#xA;  metrics:&#xA;  - type: Resource&#xA;    resource:&#xA;      name: cpu&#xA;      target:&#xA;        type: Utilization&#xA;        averageUtilization: 50&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring is also essential to track the performance and health of your temporary environment. Tools like Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization can be integrated to monitor the environment’s metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5: Implement Cleanup Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;To ensure that resources are not wasted, set up automatic cleanup procedures to tear down the environment after use. This can be scheduled using cron jobs or integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to destroy the environment once the testing is complete:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;kubectl delete namespace your-environment-name&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or a more controlled cleanup with Helm&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;helm uninstall your-application-release -n your-environment-name&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6: Documentation and Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, document the entire process and provide training for your teams. This ensures that everyone understands how to efficiently use ephemeral environments, which helps in maximizing the benefits while minimizing potential disruptions or misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Manually creating and deleting the namespaces, and integrating it within pipelines can be something a big pain when it comes to developer productivity. Integrating different tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, Jenkins, ArgoCD, KEDA, etc can be a tedius task for DevOps / SRE engineers as well. With the the involvement of custom scripting, again the complexities increases, high rish to human errors. With Devtron’s simplified workflow, it becomes a lot more easier to automate the process, and improve the developer productivity while reducing its high dependencies from DevOps/ SRE teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;how-devtron-simplifies-ephemeral-environments&#34;&gt;How Devtron Simplifies Ephemeral Environments?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Devtron enhances the management of ephemeral environments through its modern dashboard, simplified workflows, automation and effective cost-management strategies. Here are key features:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Namespace Utilization&lt;/strong&gt;: In Kubernetes, namespaces provide logical separation, allowing multiple ephemeral environments within the same cluster without additional cost. Devtron leverages this to minimize the overhead associated with setting up and tearing down environments.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Management&lt;/strong&gt;: Devtron implements strategies such as leveraging spot instances and right-sizing resources, ensuring that the infrastructure costs are kept to a minimum. For example, by using spot instances, organizations can save up to 70-90% compared to standard costs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Scaling&lt;/strong&gt;: Devtron employs tools like KEDA for event-driven autoscaling, ensuring resources are used efficiently. Environments can scale down automatically during inactivity and scale up when needed, further optimizing costs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplified Workflow:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Devtron provides an intuitive dashboard for all operating on Kubernetes, providing Kubernetes-native CI/CD pipelines, simplifying the heavy scripting and stitching up of different tools to complete an end-to-end workflow.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along with that, there are many other factors which makes the entire process much more seamless, such as visibility of workloads, application metrics, configurations management, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;setting-up-ephemeral-environments-with-devtron&#34;&gt;Setting-up Ephemeral Environments With Devtron&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Devtron is a Software Distribution Platform designed for Kubernetes.

To configure the ephemeral environment for any application, the process remains the same and you should be able to configure/ clone the workflows for different applications. Navigate to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Workflow Editor&lt;/code&gt;, add a workflow for the respective environment where you want to deploy your applications, in our case, its&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dev-testing&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;environment as you can see in the below image.

These environments are short-lived, designed to exist only for the duration of their use case—like testing a feature branch—before being dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ephemeral environments contrast with traditional static environments, which are permanent and can lead to inefficiencies, especially when underutilized. They offer a dynamic approach, allowing developers to create an isolated environment on demand without affecting the main codebase or other ongoing development activities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;the-technical-and-business-value-of-ephemeral-environments&#34;&gt;The Technical and Business Value of Ephemeral Environments&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ephemeral environments provide significant advantages in different sectors as mentioned below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;: By creating environments only when needed and tearing them down afterward, organizations avoid the cost of maintaining idle resources. This is particularly beneficial for companies where lower-end environments such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dev-env&lt;/code&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;non-prod&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;can cost up to five times more than production environments.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agility and Speed&lt;/strong&gt;: Developers can quickly spin up environments to test new features or bug fixes without waiting for access to a shared environment. This agility accelerates development cycles and time-to-market.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;: Testing in isolated environments ensures that unstable code does not affect the rest of the system, reducing the risk of bugs in production.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;is-an-ephemeral-environment-right-for-you&#34;&gt;Is an Ephemeral Environment Right for You?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deciding whether ephemeral environments are suitable for your organization involves considering your development needs and organizational goals. Key questions include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do your development teams frequently need isolated environments for testing?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are you looking to optimize costs associated with non-production environments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is there a need to increase deployment speed and reduce risk in production?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you answered “yes” to any of these, ephemeral environments could be highly beneficial for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;traditional-approach-to-ephemeral-environment&#34;&gt;Traditional Approach to Ephemeral Environment&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ephemeral environment as mentioned above are the short lived environments, created and destroyed once the task is completed. We can create our scripts maybe in Terraform or Ansible or in python/shell to spin up a complete new environment that can be your VM Machines or Kubernetes clusters. Even though the automation can be achieved, there are few disadvantages associated with this approach, that include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay in Releases:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The time taken to bring up the entire infrastructure can lead to delays in testing features or conducting sanity checks for bug fixes, resulting in a longer time to market.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Complexity:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Creating and maintaining scripts to standardize environments across different stages can be complex and error-prone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Interventions:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Even with automation scripts, manual interventions are often required to configure and install dependencies based on the application’s specific requirements, adding to the setup time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DevOps Dependencies:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Developers typically lack expertise in tools like Terraform or Ansible, making them dependent on DevOps or SRE teams to make changes and install dependencies for their applications, which can slow down the development process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Management:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Managing the lifecycle of ephemeral environments can be challenging. These environments need to be deleted once tasks are completed; otherwise, they lead to resource wastage and increased costs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Infra Cost:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The costs associated with spinning up and maintaining ephemeral environments, particularly in cloud-based setups, can add significantly to the overall infrastructure expenses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;rethinking-ephemeral-environments&#34;&gt;Rethinking Ephemeral Environments&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we talk in terms of Kubernetes, setting up Ephemeral Environments becomes a lot easier than the traditional approach. Kubernetes has a beautiful thing called namespaces, a logical separation of group of resources, providing isolation of workloads within the same cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By leveraging namespaces and some advanced autoscaling methods, it becomes much more easier to create a ephemeral environment that is cost-effective, less complex and helps you dynamically bring up the resources and hibernate when not in use. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;how-to-set-up-an-ephemeral-environment-in-k8s-manually&#34;&gt;How to Set Up an Ephemeral Environment in K8s Manually?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Setting up an ephemeral environment, especially within a Kubernetes ecosystem, involves several key steps that ensure agility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Below, we detail a straightforward approach to creating and managing these temporary environments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Define Your Infrastructure Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before you create an ephemeral environment, it’s essential to understand the specific requirements of the application or feature being tested. This includes the necessary computing resources, the required services, and any dependencies that need to be replicated from the production environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Automate the Environment Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Automation is crucial in managing ephemeral environments to ensure they can be spun up and torn down efficiently. Tools like Terraform or Ansible can be used to script the creation of your infrastructure. In Kubernetes, you might automate setting up namespaces, deploying container images, and configuring network policies through CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Kubernetes Namespaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Kubernetes, namespaces provide a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users. Each ephemeral environment can be created in its namespace, isolating its running processes and resources from other environments&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;kubectl create namespace your-environment-name&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Deploy Your Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the namespace is ready, deploy your application using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts. This step often involves setting up the necessary config maps and secrets to configure the application according to the environment&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;kubectl apply -f your-application-deployment.yaml -n your-environment-name&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or using Helm&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;helm install your-application-release your-helm-chart/ -n your-environment-name&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Configure Autoscaling and Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;To optimize costs and resource usage, configure autoscaling for your application workloads. Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) or a more advanced tool like KEDA can be used to automatically adjust the number of pods based on traffic or other metrics&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code lang=&#34;javascript&#34; class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2&#xA;kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler&#xA;metadata:&#xA;  name: your-application-hpa&#xA;  namespace: your-environment-name&#xA;spec:&#xA;  scaleTargetRef:&#xA;    apiVersion: apps/v1&#xA;    kind: Deployment&#xA;    name: your-application-deployment&#xA;  minReplicas: 1&#xA;  maxReplicas: 10&#xA;  metrics:&#xA;  - type: Resource&#xA;    resource:&#xA;      name: cpu&#xA;      target:&#xA;        type: Utilization&#xA;        averageUtilization: 50&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring is also essential to track the performance and health of your temporary environment. Tools like Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization can be integrated to monitor the environment’s metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5: Implement Cleanup Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;To ensure that resources are not wasted, set up automatic cleanup procedures to tear down the environment after use. This can be scheduled using cron jobs or integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to destroy the environment once the testing is complete:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;kubectl delete namespace your-environment-name&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or a more controlled cleanup with Helm&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;helm uninstall your-application-release -n your-environment-name&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6: Documentation and Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, document the entire process and provide training for your teams. This ensures that everyone understands how to efficiently use ephemeral environments, which helps in maximizing the benefits while minimizing potential disruptions or misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Manually creating and deleting the namespaces, and integrating it within pipelines can be something a big pain when it comes to developer productivity. Integrating different tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, Jenkins, ArgoCD, KEDA, etc can be a tedius task for DevOps / SRE engineers as well. With the the involvement of custom scripting, again the complexities increases, high rish to human errors. With Devtron’s simplified workflow, it becomes a lot more easier to automate the process, and improve the developer productivity while reducing its high dependencies from DevOps/ SRE teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;how-devtron-simplifies-ephemeral-environments&#34;&gt;How Devtron Simplifies Ephemeral Environments?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Devtron enhances the management of ephemeral environments through its modern dashboard, simplified workflows, automation and effective cost-management strategies. Here are key features:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Namespace Utilization&lt;/strong&gt;: In Kubernetes, namespaces provide logical separation, allowing multiple ephemeral environments within the same cluster without additional cost. Devtron leverages this to minimize the overhead associated with setting up and tearing down environments.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Management&lt;/strong&gt;: Devtron implements strategies such as leveraging spot instances and right-sizing resources, ensuring that the infrastructure costs are kept to a minimum. For example, by using spot instances, organizations can save up to 70-90% compared to standard costs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Scaling&lt;/strong&gt;: Devtron employs tools like KEDA for event-driven autoscaling, ensuring resources are used efficiently. Environments can scale down automatically during inactivity and scale up when needed, further optimizing costs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplified Workflow:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Devtron provides an intuitive dashboard for all operating on Kubernetes, providing Kubernetes-native CI/CD pipelines, simplifying the heavy scripting and stitching up of different tools to complete an end-to-end workflow.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along with that, there are many other factors which makes the entire process much more seamless, such as visibility of workloads, application metrics, configurations management, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;setting-up-ephemeral-environments-with-devtron&#34;&gt;Setting-up Ephemeral Environments With Devtron&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Devtron is a Software Distribution Platform designed for Kubernetes. On its mission to democratize Kubernetes, ephemeral environments are one among the many other features, that make life easier. With Devtron’s intuitive dashboard, operations on Kubernetes become flawless, and it goes with ephemeral environments as well.

Navigate to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.devtron.ai/usage/deploy-chart/overview-of-charts?ref=devtron.ai&#34;&gt;charts store&lt;/a&gt;, search for Keda, and as you can see in the below image, you can see all charts related to Keda. Select the appropriate helm chart and deploy it. To add any helm chart which is not listed on the charts store,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://devtron.ai/blog/helm-chart-deployment/&#34;&gt;free feel to check out this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image size-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34; width=&#34;2000&#34; height=&#34;1129&#34; src=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.35.11-PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Devtron dashboard on Keda chart&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-114562&#34; srcset=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.35.11-PM.jpg 2000w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.35.11-PM-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.35.11-PM-1024x578.jpg 1024w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.35.11-PM-768x434.jpg 768w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.35.11-PM-900x508.jpg 900w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.35.11-PM-1800x1016.jpg 1800w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.35.11-PM-354x200.jpg 354w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.35.11-PM-709x400.jpg 709w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-element-caption&#34;&gt;[Fig. 1] KEDA HTTP Add-on Controller&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Once the controller has been successfully installed, you can see a consolidated view of the deployed helm chart, along with its resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image size-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34; width=&#34;2000&#34; height=&#34;1129&#34; src=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.40.27-PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot showing Devtron dashboard on Helm Apps/keda-http-addon&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-114564&#34; srcset=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.40.27-PM.jpg 2000w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.40.27-PM-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.40.27-PM-1024x578.jpg 1024w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.40.27-PM-768x434.jpg 768w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.40.27-PM-900x508.jpg 900w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.40.27-PM-1800x1016.jpg 1800w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.40.27-PM-354x200.jpg 354w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-11-at-3.40.27-PM-709x400.jpg 709w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-element-caption&#34;&gt;[Fig. 2] Controller Successfully Deployed&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Now, let’s move and configure the ephemeral environment for my microservice called,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;payment-svc&lt;/code&gt;. To configure the ephemeral environment for any application, the process remains the same and you should be able to configure/ clone the workflows for different applications. Navigate to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Workflow Editor&lt;/code&gt;, add a workflow for the respective environment where you want to deploy your applications, in our case, its&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dev-testing&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;environment as you can see in the below image.

Under the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;environment override&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dev-testing&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;environment, we can add the relevant configurations required in the deployment template which would create the HttpScaledObject, responsible for bringing the environment up and running dynamically as it receives any HTTP request.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image size-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34; width=&#34;2000&#34; height=&#34;1128&#34; src=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-4.46.31-PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot showing Devtron Apps highlighted on deployment template&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-114566&#34; srcset=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-4.46.31-PM.jpg 2000w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-4.46.31-PM-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-4.46.31-PM-1024x578.jpg 1024w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-4.46.31-PM-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-4.46.31-PM-900x508.jpg 900w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-4.46.31-PM-1800x1015.jpg 1800w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-4.46.31-PM-355x200.jpg 355w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-4.46.31-PM-709x400.jpg 709w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-element-caption&#34;&gt;[Fig. 4] Configuring HTTPScaledObject&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Step 5: After providing the relevant configuration, navigate to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Build &amp;amp; Deploy&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;section, select the relevant image, and deploy it in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dev-testing&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;environment. Upon successful deployment, you can see the application status as Healthy, and all details about the deployment are as you can see in the below image.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image size-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34; width=&#34;2000&#34; height=&#34;1127&#34; src=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.14.09-PM-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot showing Devtron Apps dashboard highlighted on Build &amp;amp; Deploy&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-114568&#34; srcset=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.14.09-PM-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.14.09-PM-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.14.09-PM-1-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.14.09-PM-1-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.14.09-PM-1-900x507.jpg 900w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.14.09-PM-1-1800x1014.jpg 1800w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.14.09-PM-1-355x200.jpg 355w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.14.09-PM-1-710x400.jpg 710w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-element-caption&#34;&gt;[Fig. 5] Application Details&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also see all the resources deployed along with the deployment in a resourced grouped view, and perform operations such as checking the logs, events, manifests, or exec into the terminals. You can notice in the below image that, we have a Deployment object but there isn’t any pod running as of now. This is because it automatically scaled down the workload since there is no HTTP request hitting the given hostname/ service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image size-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34; width=&#34;2000&#34; height=&#34;1128&#34; src=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.28.14-PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot showing Devtron Apps dashboard&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-114569&#34; srcset=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.28.14-PM.jpg 2000w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.28.14-PM-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.28.14-PM-1024x578.jpg 1024w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.28.14-PM-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.28.14-PM-900x508.jpg 900w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.28.14-PM-1800x1015.jpg 1800w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.28.14-PM-355x200.jpg 355w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.28.14-PM-709x400.jpg 709w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-element-caption&#34;&gt;[Fig. 6] Deployment &amp;amp; ReplicaSet&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Step 6: In the Devtron dashboard, it automatically picks up the ingress host and shows it in&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;URLs&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;section at the top right of the dashboard as you can see in Fig. 5, and if any request has been made into the hostname, it will automatically scale up the pod and it can serve the traffic as you can see in the below image.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image size-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34; width=&#34;2000&#34; height=&#34;1126&#34; src=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.51.33-PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot showing Devtron Apps dashboard&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-114570&#34; srcset=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.51.33-PM.jpg 2000w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.51.33-PM-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.51.33-PM-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.51.33-PM-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.51.33-PM-900x507.jpg 900w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.51.33-PM-1800x1013.jpg 1800w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.51.33-PM-355x200.jpg 355w, https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-06-15-at-6.51.33-PM-710x400.jpg 710w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-element-caption&#34;&gt;[Fig. 7] Dynamically Scaled-up Pod&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ephemeral environments offer a flexible, cost-effective solution for managing development stages, particularly in a dynamic and fast-paced software development landscape. Devtron’s approach not only simplifies the management of these environments but also enhances cost efficiency and deployment agility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organizations looking to streamline their development processes and reduce costs should consider implementing ephemeral environments, especially those already using Kubernetes. With Devtron, the transition is smoother, allowing teams to focus more on innovation and less on infrastructure management.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to join our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://discord.devtron.ai/?ref=devtron.ai&#34;&gt;Discord Community&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;if you have any questions.

      <title>【Building a zero CVE strategy】制定零 CVE 策略</title>
      <link>https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/07/24/building-a-zero-cve-strategy/</link>
      <description>【&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Member post originally published on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kubesimplify.com/building-a-zero-cve-strategy&#34;&gt;Kubesimplify blog&lt;/a&gt; by Kunal Verma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the increase in software complexity and as digital threats evolve (as discussed in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.kubesimplify.com/supply-chain-security-using-slsa-part-1-fundamentals#heading-threat-points-for-a-software-supply-chain&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;our previous blog&lt;/a&gt;) in today’s digital age, the organizations are facing a massive increase in number of security vulnerabilities. According to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.coalitioninc.com/announcements/cyber-threat-index-2024&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Coalition Cyber Threat Index 2024&lt;/a&gt;, we can expect a 25% rise in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), reaching almost 34,888 this year – which is an astounding number!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such a rise in CVEs presents a significant challenge for IT professionals who must constantly identify, prioritize, and remediate these vulnerabilities. This process, often pretty overwhelming, is commonly termed as “CVE Fatigue” and can lead to missed vulnerabilities and an increased risk of cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we will delve into the primary causes of CVE fatigue and discuss some actionable strategies to minimize CVE fatigue. Thus, guiding organizations towards a more controlled and secure environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;heading-what-is-cve-fatigue&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kubesimplify.com/building-a-zero-cve-strategy#heading-what-is-cve-fatigue&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What is CVE Fatigue?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not already familiar with the term CVEs, it stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. These are standardized identifiers for known software and hardware vulnerabilities. The purpose of the CVE system is to provide a standardized way to identify and describe vulnerabilities, making it easier for organizations to prioritize and address security issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more detailed information on CVEs, you can refer to the article.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CVE Fatigue on the other hand is a common term which is used to describe the overwhelming feeling experienced by developers and IT professionals due to the constant influx of new CVEs being introduced in the industry, that require immediate attention.

In this breach, attackers exploited a known vulnerability (&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2017-5638&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;CVE-2017-5638&lt;/a&gt;) in the Apache Struts framework. Although a patch for this vulnerability had been available for months, it was not applied in time, leading to the exposure of sensitive personal information of approximately 147.9 million individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Equifax breach is one of the prime examples of CVE fatigue because the company’s security team was likely overwhelmed by the sheer volume of vulnerabilities needing attention, which led to the delay in patching a critical vulnerability. This incident underscores the importance of effective vulnerability management and the dire consequences of CVE fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you know?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;the global average cost of a data br&lt;/a&gt;each in 2023 was $4.45 million, a 15% increase over three years. This certainly highlights the financial impact of CVE breaches and the importance of addressing CVE fatigue to prevent such costly incidents and most importantly – the customer’s trust!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;heading-proven-strategies-to-reduce-cve-fatigue&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kubesimplify.com/building-a-zero-cve-strategy#heading-proven-strategies-to-reduce-cve-fatigue&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Proven Strategies to Reduce CVE Fatigue&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CVE fatigue is a significant challenge for many organizations, arising from several key issues. By understanding the root causes and applying proven strategies, we can effectively mitigate this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;heading-use-minimal-dependencies&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kubesimplify.com/building-a-zero-cve-strategy#heading-use-minimal-dependencies&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Use Minimal Dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of CVEs published each year can overwhelm security teams. With thousands of new vulnerabilities to assess and address, security teams are overwhelmed with alerts that require immediate attention. This high volume makes it difficult to keep up, leading to delayed responses and potential oversights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check out the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/cybersecurity-vulnerability-statistics/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;CVE statistics and facts report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information on the rise of CVEs between 2019-2024.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reducing the number of dependencies from the start can significantly decrease the number of potential vulnerabilities. For many companies and distributions, the common practice is to start with a general-purpose Linux image and strip away the things that aren’t needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: This is what&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;DockerSlim&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;does by taking an existing image and removing unnecessary components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this approach results in a smaller version of the main distribution, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Minimal&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Ubuntu minimal&lt;/a&gt;, a more efficient way is to add only the necessary dependencies from the start. You can use minimal base images like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Distroless&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for this purpose, but it isn’t straightforward to add or remove OS packages with this approach. Even a small dependency can cause a significant breach! And, if a developer doesn’t find a package they need in these minimal images, they often switch to much larger images instead of adding just the OS package they need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.siderolabs.com/blog/there-are-only-12-binaries-in-talos-linux/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Talos Linux&lt;/a&gt;, which includes only 12 binaries compared to other systems with hundreds, is a great example of this strategy, as its designed from scratch to include only what is needed. This approach limits the attack surface and reduces the burden on security teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: If you’re wondering how to have complete control over the OS packages your app needs, check out&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://buildsafe.dev/guides/getting-started/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;BuildSafe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;heading-have-a-dependency-update-mechanism&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kubesimplify.com/building-a-zero-cve-strategy#heading-have-a-dependency-update-mechanism&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a Dependency Update Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Effective management of software dependencies is critical in addressing CVE fatigue and minimizing vulnerabilities. Using a declarative format for dependencies helps eliminate&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/the-pain-of-implicit-dependencies&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;implicit behavior problems&lt;/a&gt;. Declarative dependency management makes it clear which dependencies are being used, making it easier to track and update them. By explicitly declaring all dependencies in configuration files, teams can easily manage and automate updates, ensuring that all components are up-to-date and secure. Tools like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/dependabot&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Dependabot&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;automate this process by checking for outdated dependencies and creating pull requests to update them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s important to note that Dependabot cannot handle OS package updates because projects don’t typically have OS dependencies defined declaratively. This inconsistency makes it hard to track and update them, leading to unnoticed security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, very few package managers, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://nixos.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;, declaratively define OS dependencies per project, making this an ongoing challenge in dependency management.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: The team at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://buildsafe.dev/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;BuildSafe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is working on a GitHub bot to address this issue for OS dependencies.

This fragmentation highlights how different repositories handle packages and the inefficiencies of using multiple package managers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://nixos.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;stands out for having one of the largest package ecosystems with the least potential CVEs, highlighting its robustness and security!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://repology.org/repositories/statistics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1720774255368/95cb1738-9ce5-470f-8938-3323bedbe233.png?auto=compress,format&amp;amp;format=webp&#34; alt=&#34;Repology Statistics&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;heading-use-a-single-package-manager-and-automated-patching&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kubesimplify.com/building-a-zero-cve-strategy#heading-use-a-single-package-manager-and-automated-patching&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Use a Single Package Manager and Automated Patching&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Managing multiple package ecosystems can overwhelm security teams, leading to inefficiencies and delayed patching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enforcing the use of a single package manager across an organization simplifies dependency management. A single package manager provides a unified ecosystem, making it easier for security teams to track and update dependencies. For instance, when there’s a CVE out and the security team is responsible for patching mission-critical software, they often need to send patches to the upstream package repository. Imagine if you and your team had to do this for five different package ecosystems, each with its own build recipes and specific requirements, because of a single CVE – what a nightmare!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, as companies grow, the aim should be to have an internal package registry where dependencies are vetted by the security team before being used by developers. These internal repositories can mirror public ones while adding and maintaining additional packages with security checks and automated update strategies. This approach not only reduces the complexity and workload for security teams but also ensures that all dependencies are consistently managed and secure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thoughts:&lt;br&gt;Imagine the benefits if we could share a package manager across both our development and runtime environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://nixos.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful package manager allows us to do this, but more on that in a future article.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/introducing-wolfi-the-first-linux-un-distro&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Wolfi by Chainguard&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a good example here.

In this breach, attackers exploited a known vulnerability (&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2017-5638&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;CVE-2017-5638&lt;/a&gt;) in the Apache Struts framework. Although a patch for this vulnerability had been available for months, it was not applied in time, leading to the exposure of sensitive personal information of approximately 147.9 million individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Equifax breach is one of the prime examples of CVE fatigue because the company’s security team was likely overwhelmed by the sheer volume of vulnerabilities needing attention, which led to the delay in patching a critical vulnerability. This incident underscores the importance of effective vulnerability management and the dire consequences of CVE fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you know?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;the global average cost of a data br&lt;/a&gt;each in 2023 was $4.45 million, a 15% increase over three years. This certainly highlights the financial impact of CVE breaches and the importance of addressing CVE fatigue to prevent such costly incidents and most importantly – the customer’s trust!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;heading-proven-strategies-to-reduce-cve-fatigue&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kubesimplify.com/building-a-zero-cve-strategy#heading-proven-strategies-to-reduce-cve-fatigue&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Proven Strategies to Reduce CVE Fatigue&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CVE fatigue is a significant challenge for many organizations, arising from several key issues. By understanding the root causes and applying proven strategies, we can effectively mitigate this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;heading-use-minimal-dependencies&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kubesimplify.com/building-a-zero-cve-strategy#heading-use-minimal-dependencies&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Use Minimal Dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of CVEs published each year can overwhelm security teams. With thousands of new vulnerabilities to assess and address, security teams are overwhelmed with alerts that require immediate attention. This high volume makes it difficult to keep up, leading to delayed responses and potential oversights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check out the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/cybersecurity-vulnerability-statistics/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;CVE statistics and facts report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information on the rise of CVEs between 2019-2024.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reducing the number of dependencies from the start can significantly decrease the number of potential vulnerabilities. For many companies and distributions, the common practice is to start with a general-purpose Linux image and strip away the things that aren’t needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: This is what&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;DockerSlim&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;does by taking an existing image and removing unnecessary components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this approach results in a smaller version of the main distribution, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Minimal&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Ubuntu minimal&lt;/a&gt;, a more efficient way is to add only the necessary dependencies from the start. You can use minimal base images like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Distroless&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for this purpose, but it isn’t straightforward to add or remove OS packages with this approach. Even a small dependency can cause a significant breach! And, if a developer doesn’t find a package they need in these minimal images, they often switch to much larger images instead of adding just the OS package they need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.siderolabs.com/blog/there-are-only-12-binaries-in-talos-linux/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Talos Linux&lt;/a&gt;, which includes only 12 binaries compared to other systems with hundreds, is a great example of this strategy, as its designed from scratch to include only what is needed. This approach limits the attack surface and reduces the burden on security teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: If you’re wondering how to have complete control over the OS packages your app needs, check out&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://buildsafe.dev/guides/getting-started/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;BuildSafe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;heading-have-a-dependency-update-mechanism&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kubesimplify.com/building-a-zero-cve-strategy#heading-have-a-dependency-update-mechanism&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a Dependency Update Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Effective management of software dependencies is critical in addressing CVE fatigue and minimizing vulnerabilities. Using a declarative format for dependencies helps eliminate&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/the-pain-of-implicit-dependencies&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;implicit behavior problems&lt;/a&gt;. Declarative dependency management makes it clear which dependencies are being used, making it easier to track and update them. By explicitly declaring all dependencies in configuration files, teams can easily manage and automate updates, ensuring that all components are up-to-date and secure. Tools like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/dependabot&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Dependabot&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;automate this process by checking for outdated dependencies and creating pull requests to update them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s important to note that Dependabot cannot handle OS package updates because projects don’t typically have OS dependencies defined declaratively. This inconsistency makes it hard to track and update them, leading to unnoticed security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, very few package managers, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://nixos.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;, declaratively define OS dependencies per project, making this an ongoing challenge in dependency management.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: The team at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://buildsafe.dev/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;BuildSafe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is working on a GitHub bot to address this issue for OS dependencies.

This fragmentation highlights how different repositories handle packages and the inefficiencies of using multiple package managers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://nixos.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;stands out for having one of the largest package ecosystems with the least potential CVEs, highlighting its robustness and security!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://repology.org/repositories/statistics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1720774255368/95cb1738-9ce5-470f-8938-3323bedbe233.png?auto=compress,format&amp;amp;format=webp&#34; alt=&#34;Repology Statistics&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;heading-use-a-single-package-manager-and-automated-patching&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kubesimplify.com/building-a-zero-cve-strategy#heading-use-a-single-package-manager-and-automated-patching&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Use a Single Package Manager and Automated Patching&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Managing multiple package ecosystems can overwhelm security teams, leading to inefficiencies and delayed patching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enforcing the use of a single package manager across an organization simplifies dependency management. A single package manager provides a unified ecosystem, making it easier for security teams to track and update dependencies. For instance, when there’s a CVE out and the security team is responsible for patching mission-critical software, they often need to send patches to the upstream package repository. Imagine if you and your team had to do this for five different package ecosystems, each with its own build recipes and specific requirements, because of a single CVE – what a nightmare!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, as companies grow, the aim should be to have an internal package registry where dependencies are vetted by the security team before being used by developers. These internal repositories can mirror public ones while adding and maintaining additional packages with security checks and automated update strategies. This approach not only reduces the complexity and workload for security teams but also ensures that all dependencies are consistently managed and secure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thoughts:&lt;br&gt;Imagine the benefits if we could share a package manager across both our development and runtime environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://nixos.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful package manager allows us to do this, but more on that in a future article.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/introducing-wolfi-the-first-linux-un-distro&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Wolfi by Chainguard&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a good example here.

      <title>【Interval tree implementation in Xline】Xline 中的区间树实现</title>
      <link>https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/07/17/interval-tree-implementation-in-xline/</link>
      <description>【&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc_7KDamNKUncNHOQCVmCMuEvNplvfHvc9h4p9bq3Y_iEzQAhHX5RIRuq_EvMlEQSf3F_cYWq-1cpMmDJCE-SbvMh4_8cqa_PQ7zp3p4CxT-_uFXeVTgx1uzh4Bc7yDMQn9B1XN63zuBa0k2vukkszFjaXWLesVxHwASp2gbCqZ9dbaZ9BR5kM?key=Iv6r86UKlwDAHVdsR8rx5g&#34; alt=&#34;Image with title &#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reason for Implementing Interval Trees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a recent refactoring of Xline, we identified a performance bottleneck caused by two data structures on the critical path: the Speculative Pool and the Uncommitted Pool. These two data structures are used for conflict detection in CURP. Specifically, the protocol requires for each processed command, it is necessary to find all the commands that conflict with the current command.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the KV operations&amp;nbsp;put/get_range/delete_range, we need to consider the possible conflicts between these operations. Since each KV operation covers a range of keys, the problem becomes checking whether a given range of keys intersects with any key ranges in the pool. A plain traversal of the entire set results in a time complexity of O(n) for each query, which reduces efficiency and leads to performance bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To address this problem, we need to introduce an interval tree data structure. Interval trees support efficient insertion, deletion and query operations on overlapping intervals, all of which can be completed in O(log(n)) time. Therefore, we can use the interval tree to maintain a collection of key ranges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Interval Tree Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The interval tree implementation in Xline is based on&amp;nbsp;Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed.), which extends the self-balancing binary search tree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The interval tree is based on a binary balanced tree (e.g., a red-black tree), and the interval itself is used as the key. For an interval [low, high], we first sort the intervals by their low values, and then by their high values if the low values are the same, establishing a total order relationship for the set of intervals. If duplicate intervals are not handled, sorting by high values is unnecessary. Additionally, for each node in the balanced tree, we maintain the maximum value of high in the subtree rooted at this node, denoted as max.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insertion/Deletion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Same as insertion/deletion in red-black tree, the worst time complexity is O(log(n)).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Query Overlap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given an interval i, we need to query the current tree to see if any intervals in the tree overlap with i.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pseudo-code given in Introduction to Algorithms is as follows&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf3FeKuovVTbM21lFBSW09-203bdtPYCg_9szdhZikolKFJwXBeWw_3oBpqxTdZKAqabNHuGJlgBgaTNyAY_0vChoKJqv3x2LItLuGDv2B_5i0THxWKLjLSMtxSwEAjyXh9y6wiWAlL0CQ13ISrt9wKj6fLLhLTrNcK0wFzBmFBfUZ1LBOIn5k?key=Iv6r86UKlwDAHVdsR8rx5g&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the definition of max, the solution to this problem becomes straightforward: for a subtree T_x rooted at x, if i does not intersect x_i, then i must lie to either the left or right of x_i.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If i is on the left side of x_i, then we can rule out the right subtree, because i.high is smaller than x_i.low.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if i is on the right side of x_i: In this case, we can’t rule out the left subtree, because the intervals of nodes in the left subtree may still intersect i.

In a red-black tree, each node must reference its parent node, which requires multiple ownership of a single node instance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rc&amp;lt;RefCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I initially attempted to use Rust’s most common multi-ownership implementation, Rc&amp;lt;RefCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;, with a tree node structure similar to the following code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;struct Node&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; left: Option&amp;lt;NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; right: Option&amp;lt;NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; parent: Option&amp;lt;NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ...&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;struct NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;(Rc&amp;lt;RefCell&amp;lt;Node&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The data structure definition appears straightforward, but in practice it’s quite cumbersome to use, because RefCell requires the user to explicitly call borrow, or borrow_mut, requiring me to create numerous helper functions to simplify the implementation. Here are some examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;impl&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt; NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; fn left&amp;lt;F, R&amp;gt;(&amp;amp;self, op: F) -&amp;gt; R&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; where&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; F: FnOnce(&amp;amp;NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;) -&amp;gt; R,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; op(self.borrow().left())&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; fn parent&amp;lt;F, R&amp;gt;(&amp;amp;self, op: F) -&amp;gt; R&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; where&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; F: FnOnce(&amp;amp;NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;) -&amp;gt; R,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; op(self.borrow().parent())&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; fn set_right(&amp;amp;self, node: NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;) {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; let _ignore = self.borrow_mut().right.replace(node);&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; fn set_max(&amp;amp;self, max: T) {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; let _ignore = self.borrow_mut().max.replace(max);&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ...&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RefCell is not ergonomic to use, but even worse, we need to use a lot of Rc::clone in our code, because when traversing a tree node from the top down, we need to hold the owned type of a node, not a reference. For example, in the previously mentioned INTERVAL-SEARCH operation, every time x = x.left or x = x.right, we first need to borrow x itself, and then assign it a value. So we need to get the owned type of the left (or right) node first, and then update x to the new value. This leads to a lot of reference counting overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How substantial is this overhead? I benchmarked our implementation using random data insertion and deletion on my local setup, which includes an Intel 13600KF processor with DDR4 memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_100 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 9,821 ns/iter (+/- 263)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_1000&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 215,362 ns/iter (+/- 6,536)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_10000 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; 2,999,694 ns/iter (+/- 134,979)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_100&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 18,395 ns/iter (+/- 750)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_1000 &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 385,858 ns/iter (+/- 7,659)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_10000&amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; 5,465,355 ns/iter (+/- 114,735)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the same data and environment, compare it to the golang interval tree implementation of etcd.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;BenchmarkIntervalTreeInsert100-20 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 123747 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 12250 ns/op&lt;br&gt;BenchmarkIntervalTreeInsert1000-20&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 7119&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 189613 ns/op&lt;br&gt;BenchmarkIntervalTreeInsert10_000-20 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 340 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3237907 ns/op&lt;br&gt;BenchmarkIntervalTreeInsertRemove100-20&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 24584 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 45579 ns/op&lt;br&gt;BenchmarkIntervalTreeInsertRemove1000-20 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 344 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3462977 ns/op&lt;br&gt;BenchmarkIntervalTreeInsertRemove10_000-20 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 358284695 ns/op&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, our Rust implementation has no advantage, and even slows down insertion operations in some cases. (Note: there appears to be an issue with etcd’s node deletion implementation. Observe the increase in the number of nodes from 1000-&amp;gt;10000, the complexity may not align with O(log(n))).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thread Safety Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if we grudgingly accept the performance, a more serious problem surfaces: Rc&amp;lt;RefCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cannot be used in a multi-threaded environment! Since Xline is built on top of Rust’s Tokio runtime, it needs to share a single instance of the interval tree across multiple threads. Unfortunately, Rc itself is !Send, because reference counting inside Rc is incremented/decremented in a non-atomic way. This then results in the entire interval tree data structure not being sent to other threads. Unless we spawn a dedicated thread and communicate through a channel, we can’t use it in a multi-threaded environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Smart Pointers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we need to consider other smart pointers to resolve this issue. A natural idea is to use Arc&amp;lt;RefCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;. However, RefCell itself is !Sync, because its borrow checking can only be used within a single thread and cannot be shared across multiple threads at the same time, and Arc&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is Send if and only if T is Sync, because Arc itself allows cloning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arc&amp;lt;Mutex&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a multi-threaded environment, multiple ownership can only be achieved using Arc&amp;lt;Mutex&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;. However, this is clearly an anti-pattern for our use case, which requires a mutex on each node, and with hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes in the tree, this is impractical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QCell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After using conventional methods to no avail, we tried to use a crate called qcell, a multi-threaded alternative to RefCell. The author ingeniously addressed the issue of borrowing checks under multiple ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QCell design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the design of qcell is formally demonstrated in the GhostCell paper, I will introduce the design in the GhostCell paper here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Rust, permissions to manipulate data are tied to the data itself, i.e., you must first own the data in order to modify its state. Specifically, to modify the data T, you either need to have a T itself, or you need to have an &amp;amp;mut T.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of GhostCell’s design is to separate permissions to manipulate data from the data itself, so that for a piece of data, the data T itself is a type, and its permissions are also of a specific type, denoted P_t. This design is more flexible than Rust’s existing design because it is possible for an instance of a permission type to have permission over a collection of data, i.e., a single P_t can have multiple T’s. Under this design, as long as the permission instance itself is thread-safe, the data collection it manages is also thread-safe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To use this in a qcell, first create a QCellOwner to represent the permissions, and a QCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; to represent the stored data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;let mut owner = QCellOwner::new();&lt;br&gt;let item = Arc::new(QCell::new(&amp;amp;owner, Vec::&amp;lt;u8&amp;gt;::new()));&lt;br&gt;owner.rw(&amp;amp;item).push(0);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;QCellOwner&amp;nbsp;has read/write access to the QCells registered to it (via&amp;nbsp;QCellOwner::rwor&amp;nbsp;QCellOwner::ro&amp;nbsp;), so as long as QCellOwner is thread-safe, the data in the QCells are thread-safe too. Here QCellOwner itself is Send + Sync, and QCell can be Send + Sync as long as T satisfies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;impl&amp;lt;T: ?Sized + Send&amp;gt; Send for QCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;impl&amp;lt;T: ?Sized + Send + Sync&amp;gt; Sync for QCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using QCell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its design, QCell has a very low overhead (I won’t go into the details here) because it leverages the Rust type system so that borrow checking is done at compile time, whereas RefCell checks at runtime, so using QCell not only allows you to use it in multi-threaded environments, but also gives you a performance boost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to apply QCell to our tree implementation. Since QCell only provides internal mutability, in order to be able to use multiple ownerships, we also need to have Arc, which looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;pub struct IntervalTree {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; node_owner: QCellOwner,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ...&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;struct NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;(Arc&amp;lt;QCell&amp;lt;Node&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking good, but how’s the performance?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_100 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 41,486 ns/iter (+/- 71)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_1000&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 586,854 ns/iter (+/- 13,947)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_10000 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; 7,726,849 ns/iter (+/- 102,820)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_100&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 75,569 ns/iter (+/- 325)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_1000 &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; 1,135,232 ns/iter (+/- 7,539)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_10000&amp;nbsp; ... bench:&amp;nbsp; 15,686,474 ns/iter (+/- 194,385)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the results of the previous tests, the performance drops by a factor of 1–3. This indicates that the biggest overhead is not the cell itself, but the reference counting, and in our interval tree case, using Arc is much slower than Rc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative to using Arc would be arena allocation, which allocates memory for all objects at once and deallocates them all at once. However, this approach is unsuitable for a tree data structure because we need to allocate and deallocate node memory dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Array Analog Pointers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Performance tests show that our attempts at smart pointers fail. Using smart pointers to implement tree structures within the Rust ownership model results in poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So can we implement it without using pointers? A natural idea is to use arrays to emulate pointers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our tree structure is redesigned as follows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;pub struct IntervalTree {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; nodes: Vec&amp;lt;Node&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ...&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;pub struct Node {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; left: Option&amp;lt;u32&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; right: Option&amp;lt;u32&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; parent: Option&amp;lt;u32&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ...&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the advantage of arrays in Rust is that you don’t need to own a node, you just need to keep track of the index. Each time a new node is inserted, it is pushed one node after the nodes, and its index is nodes.len() — 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Insertion is straightforward, but what about node deletion? A naive approach would be nulling the corresponding node in the Vec, then we are left with a “hole” in our Vec. This requires maintaining extra states to keep track of this hole, so that we can reuse it for the next insertion. Moreover, this approach makes it difficult to reclaim the space of the nodes in the Vec, even if most of the nodes have already been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, how do we solve this issue? Inspired by the method used in petgraph, we can swap the node to be removed with the last node in the Vec before deleting it. This way, we can efficiently reclaim memory. Note that we also need to update the pointer to the node associated with the last node, since its position has changed. In the petgraph implementation, this operation could be time-consuming because a node may be connected to any number of other nodes. However, in our tree structure, we only need to update the parent, left child, and right child pointers of this node, making this an O(1) operation. This efficiently solves the node deletion problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s benchmark our new implementation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_100 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3,333 ns/iter (+/- 87)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_1000&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 85,477 ns/iter (+/- 3,552)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_10000 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; 1,406,707 ns/iter (+/- 20,796)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_100&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 7,157 ns/iter (+/- 69)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_1000 &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 189,277 ns/iter (+/- 3,014)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_10000&amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; 3,060,029 ns/iter (+/- 50,829)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can observe a huge performance gain with this implementation, about 1–2x faster than both the previous Rc&amp;lt;RefCell&amp;lt;Node&amp;gt;&amp;gt; approach and the golang implementation in etcd.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using arrays to emulate pointers not only solves the ownership problem easily, but also makes it more cache friendly due to the contiguous memory layout of arrays, making it even more performant than using actual pointers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summarizing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point, we have successfully implemented a interval tree using safe Rust. Through the various attempts described above, we found that using reference-counting smart pointers to implement tree or graph data structures in Rust is ineffective due to their unsuitability for memory-intensive operations. In the future, if I need to use safe Rust to implement pointer-like data structures, I would prefer to use arrays rather than smart pointers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;】&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc_7KDamNKUncNHOQCVmCMuEvNplvfHvc9h4p9bq3Y_iEzQAhHX5RIRuq_EvMlEQSf3F_cYWq-1cpMmDJCE-SbvMh4_8cqa_PQ7zp3p4CxT-_uFXeVTgx1uzh4Bc7yDMQn9B1XN63zuBa0k2vukkszFjaXWLesVxHwASp2gbCqZ9dbaZ9BR5kM?key=Iv6r86UKlwDAHVdsR8rx5g&#34; alt=&#34;Image with title &#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reason for Implementing Interval Trees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a recent refactoring of Xline, we identified a performance bottleneck caused by two data structures on the critical path: the Speculative Pool and the Uncommitted Pool.

Specifically, the protocol requires for each processed command, it is necessary to find all the commands that conflict with the current command.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the KV operations&amp;nbsp;put/get_range/delete_range, we need to consider the possible conflicts between these operations. Since each KV operation covers a range of keys, the problem becomes checking whether a given range of keys intersects with any key ranges in the pool. A plain traversal of the entire set results in a time complexity of O(n) for each query, which reduces efficiency and leads to performance bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To address this problem, we need to introduce an interval tree data structure. Interval trees support efficient insertion, deletion and query operations on overlapping intervals, all of which can be completed in O(log(n)) time. Therefore, we can use the interval tree to maintain a collection of key ranges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Interval Tree Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The interval tree implementation in Xline is based on&amp;nbsp;Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed.), which extends the self-balancing binary search tree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The interval tree is based on a binary balanced tree (e.g., a red-black tree), and the interval itself is used as the key. For an interval [low, high], we first sort the intervals by their low values, and then by their high values if the low values are the same, establishing a total order relationship for the set of intervals. If duplicate intervals are not handled, sorting by high values is unnecessary. Additionally, for each node in the balanced tree, we maintain the maximum value of high in the subtree rooted at this node, denoted as max.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insertion/Deletion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Same as insertion/deletion in red-black tree, the worst time complexity is O(log(n)).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Query Overlap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given an interval i, we need to query the current tree to see if any intervals in the tree overlap with i.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pseudo-code given in Introduction to Algorithms is as follows&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf3FeKuovVTbM21lFBSW09-203bdtPYCg_9szdhZikolKFJwXBeWw_3oBpqxTdZKAqabNHuGJlgBgaTNyAY_0vChoKJqv3x2LItLuGDv2B_5i0THxWKLjLSMtxSwEAjyXh9y6wiWAlL0CQ13ISrt9wKj6fLLhLTrNcK0wFzBmFBfUZ1LBOIn5k?key=Iv6r86UKlwDAHVdsR8rx5g&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the definition of max, the solution to this problem becomes straightforward: for a subtree T_x rooted at x, if i does not intersect x_i, then i must lie to either the left or right of x_i.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If i is on the left side of x_i, then we can rule out the right subtree, because i.high is smaller than x_i.low.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if i is on the right side of x_i: In this case, we can’t rule out the left subtree, because the intervals of nodes in the left subtree may still intersect i.

In a red-black tree, each node must reference its parent node, which requires multiple ownership of a single node instance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rc&amp;lt;RefCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I initially attempted to use Rust’s most common multi-ownership implementation, Rc&amp;lt;RefCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;, with a tree node structure similar to the following code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;struct Node&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; left: Option&amp;lt;NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; right: Option&amp;lt;NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; parent: Option&amp;lt;NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ...&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;struct NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;(Rc&amp;lt;RefCell&amp;lt;Node&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The data structure definition appears straightforward, but in practice it’s quite cumbersome to use, because RefCell requires the user to explicitly call borrow, or borrow_mut, requiring me to create numerous helper functions to simplify the implementation. Here are some examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;impl&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt; NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; fn left&amp;lt;F, R&amp;gt;(&amp;amp;self, op: F) -&amp;gt; R&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; where&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; F: FnOnce(&amp;amp;NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;) -&amp;gt; R,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; op(self.borrow().left())&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; fn parent&amp;lt;F, R&amp;gt;(&amp;amp;self, op: F) -&amp;gt; R&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; where&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; F: FnOnce(&amp;amp;NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;) -&amp;gt; R,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; op(self.borrow().parent())&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; fn set_right(&amp;amp;self, node: NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;) {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; let _ignore = self.borrow_mut().right.replace(node);&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; fn set_max(&amp;amp;self, max: T) {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; let _ignore = self.borrow_mut().max.replace(max);&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ...&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RefCell is not ergonomic to use, but even worse, we need to use a lot of Rc::clone in our code, because when traversing a tree node from the top down, we need to hold the owned type of a node, not a reference. For example, in the previously mentioned INTERVAL-SEARCH operation, every time x = x.left or x = x.right, we first need to borrow x itself, and then assign it a value. So we need to get the owned type of the left (or right) node first, and then update x to the new value. This leads to a lot of reference counting overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How substantial is this overhead? I benchmarked our implementation using random data insertion and deletion on my local setup, which includes an Intel 13600KF processor with DDR4 memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_100 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 9,821 ns/iter (+/- 263)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_1000&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 215,362 ns/iter (+/- 6,536)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_10000 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; 2,999,694 ns/iter (+/- 134,979)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_100&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 18,395 ns/iter (+/- 750)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_1000 &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 385,858 ns/iter (+/- 7,659)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_10000&amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; 5,465,355 ns/iter (+/- 114,735)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the same data and environment, compare it to the golang interval tree implementation of etcd.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;BenchmarkIntervalTreeInsert100-20 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 123747 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 12250 ns/op&lt;br&gt;BenchmarkIntervalTreeInsert1000-20&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 7119&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 189613 ns/op&lt;br&gt;BenchmarkIntervalTreeInsert10_000-20 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 340 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3237907 ns/op&lt;br&gt;BenchmarkIntervalTreeInsertRemove100-20&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 24584 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 45579 ns/op&lt;br&gt;BenchmarkIntervalTreeInsertRemove1000-20 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 344 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3462977 ns/op&lt;br&gt;BenchmarkIntervalTreeInsertRemove10_000-20 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 358284695 ns/op&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, our Rust implementation has no advantage, and even slows down insertion operations in some cases. (Note: there appears to be an issue with etcd’s node deletion implementation. Observe the increase in the number of nodes from 1000-&amp;gt;10000, the complexity may not align with O(log(n))).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thread Safety Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if we grudgingly accept the performance, a more serious problem surfaces: Rc&amp;lt;RefCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cannot be used in a multi-threaded environment! Since Xline is built on top of Rust’s Tokio runtime, it needs to share a single instance of the interval tree across multiple threads. Unfortunately, Rc itself is !Send, because reference counting inside Rc is incremented/decremented in a non-atomic way. This then results in the entire interval tree data structure not being sent to other threads. Unless we spawn a dedicated thread and communicate through a channel, we can’t use it in a multi-threaded environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Smart Pointers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we need to consider other smart pointers to resolve this issue. A natural idea is to use Arc&amp;lt;RefCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;. However, RefCell itself is !Sync, because its borrow checking can only be used within a single thread and cannot be shared across multiple threads at the same time, and Arc&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is Send if and only if T is Sync, because Arc itself allows cloning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arc&amp;lt;Mutex&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a multi-threaded environment, multiple ownership can only be achieved using Arc&amp;lt;Mutex&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;. However, this is clearly an anti-pattern for our use case, which requires a mutex on each node, and with hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes in the tree, this is impractical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QCell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After using conventional methods to no avail, we tried to use a crate called qcell, a multi-threaded alternative to RefCell. The author ingeniously addressed the issue of borrowing checks under multiple ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QCell design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the design of qcell is formally demonstrated in the GhostCell paper, I will introduce the design in the GhostCell paper here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Rust, permissions to manipulate data are tied to the data itself, i.e., you must first own the data in order to modify its state. Specifically, to modify the data T, you either need to have a T itself, or you need to have an &amp;amp;mut T.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of GhostCell’s design is to separate permissions to manipulate data from the data itself, so that for a piece of data, the data T itself is a type, and its permissions are also of a specific type, denoted P_t. This design is more flexible than Rust’s existing design because it is possible for an instance of a permission type to have permission over a collection of data, i.e., a single P_t can have multiple T’s. Under this design, as long as the permission instance itself is thread-safe, the data collection it manages is also thread-safe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To use this in a qcell, first create a QCellOwner to represent the permissions, and a QCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; to represent the stored data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;let mut owner = QCellOwner::new();&lt;br&gt;let item = Arc::new(QCell::new(&amp;amp;owner, Vec::&amp;lt;u8&amp;gt;::new()));&lt;br&gt;owner.rw(&amp;amp;item).push(0);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;QCellOwner&amp;nbsp;has read/write access to the QCells registered to it (via&amp;nbsp;QCellOwner::rwor&amp;nbsp;QCellOwner::ro&amp;nbsp;), so as long as QCellOwner is thread-safe, the data in the QCells are thread-safe too. Here QCellOwner itself is Send + Sync, and QCell can be Send + Sync as long as T satisfies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;impl&amp;lt;T: ?Sized + Send&amp;gt; Send for QCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;impl&amp;lt;T: ?Sized + Send + Sync&amp;gt; Sync for QCell&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using QCell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its design, QCell has a very low overhead (I won’t go into the details here) because it leverages the Rust type system so that borrow checking is done at compile time, whereas RefCell checks at runtime, so using QCell not only allows you to use it in multi-threaded environments, but also gives you a performance boost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to apply QCell to our tree implementation. Since QCell only provides internal mutability, in order to be able to use multiple ownerships, we also need to have Arc, which looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;pub struct IntervalTree {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; node_owner: QCellOwner,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ...&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;struct NodeRef&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;(Arc&amp;lt;QCell&amp;lt;Node&amp;lt;T, V&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking good, but how’s the performance?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_100 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 41,486 ns/iter (+/- 71)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_1000&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 586,854 ns/iter (+/- 13,947)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_10000 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; 7,726,849 ns/iter (+/- 102,820)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_100&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 75,569 ns/iter (+/- 325)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_1000 &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; 1,135,232 ns/iter (+/- 7,539)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_10000&amp;nbsp; ... bench:&amp;nbsp; 15,686,474 ns/iter (+/- 194,385)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the results of the previous tests, the performance drops by a factor of 1–3. This indicates that the biggest overhead is not the cell itself, but the reference counting, and in our interval tree case, using Arc is much slower than Rc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative to using Arc would be arena allocation, which allocates memory for all objects at once and deallocates them all at once. However, this approach is unsuitable for a tree data structure because we need to allocate and deallocate node memory dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Array Analog Pointers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Performance tests show that our attempts at smart pointers fail. Using smart pointers to implement tree structures within the Rust ownership model results in poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So can we implement it without using pointers? A natural idea is to use arrays to emulate pointers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our tree structure is redesigned as follows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;pub struct IntervalTree {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; nodes: Vec&amp;lt;Node&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ...&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;pub struct Node {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; left: Option&amp;lt;u32&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; right: Option&amp;lt;u32&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; parent: Option&amp;lt;u32&amp;gt;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ...&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the advantage of arrays in Rust is that you don’t need to own a node, you just need to keep track of the index. Each time a new node is inserted, it is pushed one node after the nodes, and its index is nodes.len() — 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Insertion is straightforward, but what about node deletion? A naive approach would be nulling the corresponding node in the Vec, then we are left with a “hole” in our Vec. This requires maintaining extra states to keep track of this hole, so that we can reuse it for the next insertion. Moreover, this approach makes it difficult to reclaim the space of the nodes in the Vec, even if most of the nodes have already been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, how do we solve this issue? Inspired by the method used in petgraph, we can swap the node to be removed with the last node in the Vec before deleting it. This way, we can efficiently reclaim memory. Note that we also need to update the pointer to the node associated with the last node, since its position has changed. In the petgraph implementation, this operation could be time-consuming because a node may be connected to any number of other nodes. However, in our tree structure, we only need to update the parent, left child, and right child pointers of this node, making this an O(1) operation. This efficiently solves the node deletion problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s benchmark our new implementation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;&#34;&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_100 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3,333 ns/iter (+/- 87)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_1000&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 85,477 ns/iter (+/- 3,552)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_10000 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; 1,406,707 ns/iter (+/- 20,796)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_100&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 7,157 ns/iter (+/- 69)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_1000 &amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 189,277 ns/iter (+/- 3,014)&lt;br&gt;test bench_interval_tree_insert_remove_10000&amp;nbsp; ... bench: &amp;nbsp; 3,060,029 ns/iter (+/- 50,829)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can observe a huge performance gain with this implementation, about 1–2x faster than both the previous Rc&amp;lt;RefCell&amp;lt;Node&amp;gt;&amp;gt; approach and the golang implementation in etcd.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using arrays to emulate pointers not only solves the ownership problem easily, but also makes it more cache friendly due to the contiguous memory layout of arrays, making it even more performant than using actual pointers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summarizing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point, we have successfully implemented a interval tree using safe Rust. Through the various attempts described above, we found that using reference-counting smart pointers to implement tree or graph data structures in Rust is ineffective due to their unsuitability for memory-intensive operations. In the future, if I need to use safe Rust to implement pointer-like data structures, I would prefer to use arrays rather than smart pointers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>【&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community post by Andrés Vega&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;M42 and Technical Leader, CNCF TAG Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recent events involving CrowdStrike’s Falcon security software have underscored a critical lesson across the industry: the importance of having a robust, secure release process. Such incidents serve as reminder of the consequences that can result from issues in software updates. These consequences can affect a wide range of critical industries and services, from government agencies and financial institutions to healthcare systems and emergency services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Incident&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On July 18, 2024, a buggy update to CrowdStrike’s Falcon security software caused widespread system crashes across their customer base. Windows-based systems experienced a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), the kernel panic of Windows systems, leading to significant disruptions in critical services, including government agencies, banks, airlines, payment processors, 911 call centers, television networks, and health systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aftermath of this incident has been challenging, with organizations scrambling to implement fixes ranging from simple reboots to complex recovery procedures involving encrypted disks. This situation highlights the need for more robust safeguards in the software release process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Justin Cappos, Professor at NYU and co-creator of in-toto, expressed his shock at the incident:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It strains credibility that any organization, much less a security company, would fail to have robust software supply chain validation mechanisms in place. The fact that software could be released without testing demonstrates a level of negligence, I’m shocked to see from a major security company.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This statement underscores the gravity of the situation and the critical need for robust software supply chain validation in all organizations, especially those dealing with critical security software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Self-Inflicted Ransomware Comparison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One particularly concerning aspect of this incident was highlighted by cryptography and infrastructure engineer Tony Arcieri on Mastodon. He drew a comparison between the situation and a self inflicted a ransomware attack:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&#34;async&#34; src=&#34;https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfm8mGJ3UI0VMldJn2JU1BnAFTayg5AVIsR7qCWonqI5Qdzmy_vxzhdw6MoQp_W-lF1rq4YBq-WsPBbytootw5bUz7YmJVNlIhaXqbT7O398NakcSpYoV5mN8yyJ-sX0liENCjRR9wBzBOPfZoSIJGChW2P?key=37GriDsC10OyLqy2cSTSGQ&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;no-referrer&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This comparison underscores the critical importance of not just having robust release processes, but also maintaining proper key management practices. Without access to these recovery keys, organizations find themselves in a situation where they can’t access their own encrypted data – mimicking the effects of a ransomware attack, but caused by their own security measures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Need for Robust Release Processes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This incident emphasizes the critical need for robust release processes that are not just guidelines, but technically enforced safeguards. As Cappos points out:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Release processes aren’t just a checklist of best practices. They should be enforced technically in a way that makes it implausible to bypass these safeguards. This technical enforcement is key to preventing incidents like the one we are seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, let’s explore the critical components of a robust release process:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive Testing&lt;/strong&gt;: Thorough testing of updates in environments that closely mimic production systems.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrity Verification: &lt;/strong&gt;Use cryptographic techniques to verify the integrity of each step in the release process, ensuring that no authorized changes can be made without detection.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staged Rollouts&lt;/strong&gt;: Implementing gradual rollout strategies to detect issues before they affect a wide user base.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Rollback Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;: The ability to swiftly revert to a previous stable version when issues are detected.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparent Communication&lt;/strong&gt;: Clear, timely communication with affected users about the nature of the problem and steps for resolution.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proper Key Management&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensure that encryption keys and recovery keys are properly managed and readily available when needed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By enforcing these processes in software, organizations can create more robust systems where it becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible, to release software updates without going through all the necessary security checks and balances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in-toto: The Blueprint for Secure and Verifiable Software Updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the CNCF Security Advisory Group, we strongly advocate for the adoption of frameworks that can help prevent such incidents. One such framework is in-toto, which provides a comprehensive approach to supply chain security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is in-toto?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in-toto is an open-source framework that cryptographically ensures the integrity of the software supply chain. It allows for the definition of supply chain layouts and the creation of cryptographically verifiable metadata about the steps in the chain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An in-toto layout specifies:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The steps that should occur in the software supply chain&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The order in which these steps should happen, these will be enforced as verification procedures to be carried out on the final product.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Who is authorized to perform each step through the use of cryptographic keys.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What materials (input) each step should use and what products (output) it should generate, as well as thresholds&amp;nbsp; Determine how many signatures are required for a step to be considered valid.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example of a Simple in-toto Layout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simplified example of what an in-toto layout might look like for a basic software release process:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-table&#34;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;{&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; “steps”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “name”: “code-review”,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_materials”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“MATCH”, “src/*”, “WITH”, “PRODUCTS”, “FROM”, “coding”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_products”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“MATCH”, “src/*”, “WITH”, “MATERIALS”, “FROM”, “coding”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “pubkeys”: [“4895703d8b8f0a8369348e5e2f364e8a312273e8”],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_command”: [“git”, “push”, “origin”, “main”],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “threshold”: 1&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; },&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “name”: “unit-test”,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_materials”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“MATCH”, “src/*”, “WITH”, “PRODUCTS”, “FROM”, “code-review”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_products”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“CREATE”, “test-results.xml”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “pubkeys”: [“c8650e5c8a17c1f83a2db650f438e899bd76e62c”],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_command”: [“pytest”, “tests/”],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “threshold”: 1&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; },&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “name”: “build”,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_materials”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“MATCH”, “src/*”, “WITH”, “PRODUCTS”, “FROM”, “unit-test”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_products”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“CREATE”, “dist/app-1.0.tar.gz”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “pubkeys”: [“f3b93b345b2e6f356dc4a418d66213be51b4e5f4”],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_command”: [“python”, “setup.py”, “sdist”],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “threshold”: 1&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; “inspections”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “name”: “final-product-test”,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_materials”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“MATCH”, “dist/app-1.0.tar.gz”, “WITH”, “PRODUCTS”, “FROM”, “build”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_products”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“CREATE”, “test-results.xml”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “run”: [“pytest”, “tests/”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; ]&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Santiago Torres-Arias, co-creator of in-toto and Assistant Professor at Purdue University, expounds the depth of assurance that in-toto provides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Supply chain integrity is not just about securing the ‘what’ of software. Only by answering ‘how’ something was made can you be really sure of its integrity. That is where in-toto shines — it enables automated security and compliance checks throughout the entire software supply chain, ensuring not just the end product, but every step of its creation is verifiable and secure.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive approach to software supply chain integrity is crucial in preventing widespread outages from software updates. By verifying each step of the development and release process, in-toto provides a framework for catching potential issues before they can impact end-users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How in-toto Layouts Could Help Prevent Incidents Like the CrowdStrike Update Issue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Enforced Process: By defining a clear layout, in-toto ensures that all required steps in the release process are followed, reducing the chance of skipping crucial steps like thorough testing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Verification of Inputs and Outputs: Each step’s materials and products are verified, ensuring that unexpected changes aren’t introduced during the process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Authorized Actions: By specifying who can perform each action, in-toto reduces the risk of unauthorized or accidental changes to the software.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Auditability: The layout provides a clear record of what should happen in the release process, making it easier to audit and identify potential issues.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Final Product Verification: The inspection step ensures that the final product meets all specified criteria before release.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By implementing in-toto with a well-designed layout along with comprehensive testing procedures, gating criteria, and gradual rolllouts, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of releasing buggy updates, thereby preventing incidents similar to the CrowdStrike update issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Priyanka Sharma, Executive Director of CNCF emphasizes the importance of maintaining integrity in software update systems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“The recent incident with CrowdStrike’s software update serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of secure software supply chains in our increasingly interconnected digital world. At CNCF, we’ve long advocated for the adoption of robust security practices and tools throughout the entire software lifecycle. This event underscores the need for comprehensive, end-to-end security measures that go beyond traditional approaches. It’s why we support projects like in-toto, which provides a framework for ensuring the integrity of the software supply chain. As we move forward, it’s imperative that organizations not only implement best practices but also leverage cutting-edge tools and frameworks to prevent such incidents. The security of our digital infrastructure is a shared responsibility, and CNCF is committed to fostering the development and adoption of technologies that enhance the security and reliability of the cloud native ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The recent CrowdStrike incident serves as a powerful reminder of the critical importance of secure, robust release processes in software systems that people rely on in their daily lives. By learning from this event and implementing frameworks like in-toto, we can work towards preventing similar incidents in the future, ensuring the stability and security of the software we all rely on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the CNCF Security Advisory Group, we urge all organizations to take this opportunity to review and enhance their release processes. The security of our digital infrastructure depends on our collective commitment to best practices in software development and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Learn more and get started – https://in-toto.io/&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;】&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community post by Andrés Vega&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;M42 and Technical Leader, CNCF TAG Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recent events involving CrowdStrike’s Falcon security software have underscored a critical lesson across the industry: the importance of having a robust, secure release process.

It allows for the definition of supply chain layouts and the creation of cryptographically verifiable metadata about the steps in the chain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An in-toto layout specifies:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The steps that should occur in the software supply chain&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The order in which these steps should happen, these will be enforced as verification procedures to be carried out on the final product.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Who is authorized to perform each step through the use of cryptographic keys.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What materials (input) each step should use and what products (output) it should generate, as well as thresholds&amp;nbsp; Determine how many signatures are required for a step to be considered valid.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example of a Simple in-toto Layout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simplified example of what an in-toto layout might look like for a basic software release process:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-table&#34;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;{&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; “steps”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “name”: “code-review”,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_materials”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“MATCH”, “src/*”, “WITH”, “PRODUCTS”, “FROM”, “coding”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_products”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“MATCH”, “src/*”, “WITH”, “MATERIALS”, “FROM”, “coding”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “pubkeys”: [“4895703d8b8f0a8369348e5e2f364e8a312273e8”],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_command”: [“git”, “push”, “origin”, “main”],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “threshold”: 1&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; },&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “name”: “unit-test”,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_materials”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“MATCH”, “src/*”, “WITH”, “PRODUCTS”, “FROM”, “code-review”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_products”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“CREATE”, “test-results.xml”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “pubkeys”: [“c8650e5c8a17c1f83a2db650f438e899bd76e62c”],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_command”: [“pytest”, “tests/”],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “threshold”: 1&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; },&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “name”: “build”,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_materials”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“MATCH”, “src/*”, “WITH”, “PRODUCTS”, “FROM”, “unit-test”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_products”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“CREATE”, “dist/app-1.0.tar.gz”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “pubkeys”: [“f3b93b345b2e6f356dc4a418d66213be51b4e5f4”],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_command”: [“python”, “setup.py”, “sdist”],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “threshold”: 1&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; “inspections”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “name”: “final-product-test”,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_materials”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“MATCH”, “dist/app-1.0.tar.gz”, “WITH”, “PRODUCTS”, “FROM”, “build”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “expected_products”: [&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [“CREATE”, “test-results.xml”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ],&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “run”: [“pytest”, “tests/”]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; ]&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Santiago Torres-Arias, co-creator of in-toto and Assistant Professor at Purdue University, expounds the depth of assurance that in-toto provides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Supply chain integrity is not just about securing the ‘what’ of software. Only by answering ‘how’ something was made can you be really sure of its integrity. That is where in-toto shines — it enables automated security and compliance checks throughout the entire software supply chain, ensuring not just the end product, but every step of its creation is verifiable and secure.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive approach to software supply chain integrity is crucial in preventing widespread outages from software updates. By verifying each step of the development and release process, in-toto provides a framework for catching potential issues before they can impact end-users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How in-toto Layouts Could Help Prevent Incidents Like the CrowdStrike Update Issue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Enforced Process: By defining a clear layout, in-toto ensures that all required steps in the release process are followed, reducing the chance of skipping crucial steps like thorough testing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Verification of Inputs and Outputs: Each step’s materials and products are verified, ensuring that unexpected changes aren’t introduced during the process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Authorized Actions: By specifying who can perform each action, in-toto reduces the risk of unauthorized or accidental changes to the software.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Auditability: The layout provides a clear record of what should happen in the release process, making it easier to audit and identify potential issues.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Final Product Verification: The inspection step ensures that the final product meets all specified criteria before release.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By implementing in-toto with a well-designed layout along with comprehensive testing procedures, gating criteria, and gradual rolllouts, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of releasing buggy updates, thereby preventing incidents similar to the CrowdStrike update issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Priyanka Sharma, Executive Director of CNCF emphasizes the importance of maintaining integrity in software update systems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“The recent incident with CrowdStrike’s software update serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of secure software supply chains in our increasingly interconnected digital world. At CNCF, we’ve long advocated for the adoption of robust security practices and tools throughout the entire software lifecycle. This event underscores the need for comprehensive, end-to-end security measures that go beyond traditional approaches. It’s why we support projects like in-toto, which provides a framework for ensuring the integrity of the software supply chain. As we move forward, it’s imperative that organizations not only implement best practices but also leverage cutting-edge tools and frameworks to prevent such incidents. The security of our digital infrastructure is a shared responsibility, and CNCF is committed to fostering the development and adoption of technologies that enhance the security and reliability of the cloud native ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The recent CrowdStrike incident serves as a powerful reminder of the critical importance of secure, robust release processes in software systems that people rely on in their daily lives. By learning from this event and implementing frameworks like in-toto, we can work towards preventing similar incidents in the future, ensuring the stability and security of the software we all rely on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the CNCF Security Advisory Group, we urge all organizations to take this opportunity to review and enhance their release processes. The security of our digital infrastructure depends on our collective commitment to best practices in software development and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Learn more and get started – https://in-toto.io/&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

She’s the go-to person for DevOps and Kubernetes Automation, with a passion for networking, security, endpoint management, and endpoint security,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to be a Kubestronaut like Eleni, find more details on the&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/training/kubestronaut/&#34;&gt; CNCF Kubestronaut &lt;/a&gt;page.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did you get started with Kubernetes–what was your first project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My journey started back in 2019. At the time, I was a network consulting engineer involved in network automation projects. After learning about automation technologies, I was involved in container creation images and Docker. The next logical step was to work with an open source offering for container orchestration. That’s when I became familiar with Kubernetes. Setting up a home lab was just the beginning towards the exciting journey of the Kubestronaut certification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the primary CNCF projects you work on or use today? What projects have you enjoyed the most in your career?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cilium/cilium&#34;&gt;Cilium&lt;/a&gt; as CNI and Service mesh&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kyverno&#34;&gt;Kyverno&lt;/a&gt; for applying policies&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/projectsveltos&#34;&gt;Sveltos&lt;/a&gt; for Kubernetes add-on and applications deployment&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd&#34;&gt;ArgoCD&lt;/a&gt; for continuous deployments on specific topics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench/&#34;&gt;Kubebench&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trivy&#34;&gt;Trivy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/falco&#34;&gt;Falco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://kubesec.io/&#34;&gt;Kubesec.io&lt;/a&gt; for security and compliance&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/prometheus&#34;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grafana&#34;&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex&#34;&gt;Cortex&lt;/a&gt; for observability&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have the certs helped you in your career?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would say a lot. As most certifications are hands-on, there is no way to pass the exam unless you know what you are doing. It is proof to your employees and the customers you interact with that you know what exactly you are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has CNCF helped you or influenced your career?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting familiar with all these open source projects. Understanding how the community works and how I can assist in the efforts, was a mindset change!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some other books/sites/courses you recommend for people who want to work with k8s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All training material from Sander Van Vugt on O’Reilly Media&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Kodekloud team for the DevOps track including the certification preparation material&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The ‘The Linux DevOps Handbook’ By Damian Wojsław, Grzegorz Adamowicz&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The ‘Learning Helm’ By Matt Butcher, Matt Farina, Josh Dolitsky&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The ‘Programming Kubernetes’ By Michael Hausenblas, Stefan Schimanski&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The ‘Getting Started with Grafana: Real-Time Dashboards for IT and Business Operations’ By Ronald McCollam&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And many more!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you do in your free time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love nature and like to exercise! Usually, you will find me somewhere hiking and enjoying nature or practising rugby in a nearby local field. Spending quality time with family and friends is very important to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you tell someone who is just starting their K8s certification journey? Any tips or tricks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Practise, practise, practise. Hands-on and working on projects is what will do the trick! Be confident to put yourself out there, surpass your limits and learn something new every day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today the cloud native ecosystem is way more than Kubernetes. Do you plan to get other cloud native certifications from the CNCF?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it is hands-on, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you get involved with cloud native and Kubernetes in general?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I started working with Kubernetes back in 2019-2020.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34;

      <description>【&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Member post originally published on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cerbos.dev/blog/authentication-vs-authorization-understanding-the-difference&#34;&gt;Cerbos blog&lt;/a&gt; by Omu Inetimi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Authentication vs Authorization: Understanding the Difference&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In recent times, security in modern applications cannot be overemphasized. It is extremely important to ensure our applications have proper security measures to prevent sensitive data from getting into the wrong hands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, two particularly relevant concepts come to mind: authentication and authorization. They are both referred to in shorthand as “Auth” and are frequently used hand in hand when building secure applications, and as a result, their meanings can get intertwined. This article will help you understand what authentication and authorization are, and how to differentiate between these two important aspects of application security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;What is Authentication (AuthN)?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Authentication in computing is defined as the process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process. It’s how your application verifies who you say you are. Authentication within the application effectively answers the question “Who are you?”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal of authentication is mainly to ensure that only those who have permission can access the application. By verifying the identity of every user, it helps to keep sensitive data safe, block unwanted access, and preserve system security. It’s an essential part of the application because in doing so it builds trust between the user and the system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few ways the application can do this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We have the classic case of username and password – where the user provides their username and the password which is the key to the user’s account. This of course assumes that whoever has the password must be the owner of the account, which in modern security situations is not considered the best approach due to the risk of password leaks, phishing, and other methods bad actors could use to gain identification information.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Multifactor authentication is another option. To make the system more secure, this technique combines two or more authentication techniques. Usually, it requires utilizing either something you have (like a security token or smartphone), something you know (like a password), or something you are (like a fingerprint or facial recognition). Two-factor authentication (2FA) is the most popular example and it works by sending you a unique code through SMS or an email after you input your username and password. After that, you input this code into the application to have your identification confirmed. That sent code adds an extra layer of security, making it considerably more difficult for unauthorized users to obtain access even if they have access to your device or account. This combination of the account credentials plus an additional factor is what makes it truly “two-factor” authentication.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Biometric authentication is yet another method of authentication that verifies the user using biometric information. This could be done using the user’s bodily characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial IDs, retinal scans, etc., to identify them. Since no two people have the same biometric information, there is very little possibility that an attacker will be able to get around these physical restrictions, making it by far one of the most secure means of verification. This would also mean that the application system must support the hardware that collects the biometric information for verification.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples of the various methods used for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;What is Authorization (AuthZ)?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Authorization, on the other hand, is the act of allowing or refusing access to resources within an application. It often takes place following authentication and establishes the resources and permissions that an authenticated user is granted access to. Authorization essentially answers the question, “What are you allowed to do?”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Authorization is essential to make sure users have the right amount of access within the application and it does so by guaranteeing that only those with the required permission have access to specific information. Implementation of authorization contributes to the overall protection of your application from potential security risks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several ways applications can handle authorization, just to name two:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): In this case, users are given permissions according to their positions in an organization. Access rights are tied to specific roles so you could imagine a case where an ordinary user position might only have limited access, whereas an admin might have complete access to all resources. Using this method of authorization makes it so that users only have access to the information necessary for their roles while easing management.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): In this method, access is granted according to policies and attributes. User properties (such as department and job title), resource properties, and environmental properties (like access time) can all be considered attributes. ABAC offers you a flexible way to handle authorization Because the decisions made are based on a combination of policies and attributes hence giving you a higher level of control.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;AuthN vs AuthZ: Key Differences and How They Work Together&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Verification vs. Permission:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As previously stated, authentication and authorization serve distinct functions inside the security system. Authentication is used to confirm the identity of a user or process. Consider it as a way to verify yourself at the door by showing your ID. Authorization, on the other hand, focuses on ensuring that specific users have specific permissions after they enter. Think of it as the key card that allows you access to specific locations or resources depending on your position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Sequential Process:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Authentication always comes before authorization. You could think of it as a 2-step process with authentication always coming first. The system always has to verify who enters it before it can determine what these verified users are permitted to do once they’re in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Integrated Security Approach:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They work together quite well despite their differences. You can think of them as two sides of the same coin: authentication ensures that only valid users can access the program, whereas authorization ensures that those users can only access the resources they are authorized to. It’s a team effort from both ends that ensures the security of the entire application is not compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Real-World Scenario&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take Twitter for example. Before you log into your Twitter account, you have to provide your username and password. That is authentication; you’re proving to Twitter you own that account and Twitter makes sure that only you can access it. After logging in, you can send a tweet, change your profile, view, like, and comment on other users’ tweets. However, you cannot change or delete other people’s accounts or tweets. You have the authority to manage your own content and engage with others, but you cannot control other people’s accounts or carry out administrative tasks assigned to Twitter employees. That’s authorization in action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Why Choosing the Right Authorization Solution Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Scalability and Flexibility:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to authorization, having a scalable and flexible solution is very important. You want your authorization system to be able to scale as your application grows to accommodate the incoming traffic. A scalable authorization solution can handle an increasing number of users and permissions without compromising performance. Flexibility is equally important because it allows you to easily adjust permissions and roles as your application’s requirements change. Both ensure that your system remains efficient no matter how much it grows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Security Best Practices:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having an effective authorization system is a significant part of maintaining the security of your application. A good authorization setup prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data. By ensuring that only users with the correct permissions can access certain resources, you significantly reduce the risk of security breaches. This not only protects your application but also builds trust with your users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Outsourcing Complexity:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Development teams often have a natural tendency to implement their own in-house authorization solutions, assuming it’s an “easy to solve” problem. However, these homegrown solutions typically require significant maintenance and scaling efforts as the application grows in both user base and complexity. Authorization-as-a-Service solutions address this challenge by shifting the responsibility away from the development team to a finished product that already provides the necessary flexibility and scalability. This approach allows teams to focus on core application features while benefiting from a robust, professionally maintained authorization system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’ve covered a lot of ground in this article, diving deep into the world of authentication and authorization. By now, you should have a solid understanding of how these two concepts differ and why they’re both crucial in keeping your application secure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To recap, authentication is all about verifying who you are. On the other hand, authorization is about what you’re allowed to do once you’re inside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re looking to take your application’s security to the next level, I highly recommend checking out Cerbos. They’ve got a ton of resources and even a demo that you can explore.

用户提供其用户名和密码，这是用户帐户的密钥。当然，这假设拥有密码的人必须是该帐户的所有者，在现代安全情况下，这并不被认为是最好的方法，因为存在密码泄露、网络钓鱼和不良行为者可能用来获取身份信息的其他方法的风险。 &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;多重身份验证是另一种选择。为了使系统更加安全，该技术结合了两种或多种身份验证技术。通常，它需要利用您拥有的东西（例如安全令牌或智能手机）、您知道的东西（例如密码）或您的东西（例如指纹或面部识别）。双因素身份验证 (2FA) 是最流行的示例，它的工作原理是在您输入用户名和密码后通过短信或电子邮件向您发送唯一的代码。之后，您将该代码输入到应用程序中以确认您的身份。发送的代码增加了额外的安全层，使未经授权的用户更难以获得访问权限，即使他们有权访问您的设备或帐户。帐户凭据加上附加因素的组合使其成为真正的“双因素”身份验证。&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;生物识别身份验证是另一种使用生物识别信息验证用户的身份验证方法。这可以使用用户的身体特征（例如指纹、面部识别码、视网膜扫描等）来识别他们。由于没有两个人拥有相同的生物识别信息，因此攻击者几乎不可能绕过这些物理限制，这使其成为迄今为止最安全的验证手段之一。这也意味着应用系统必须支持收集生物特征信息进行验证的硬件。&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;这些只是用于身份验证的各种方法的几个示例。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;什么是授权 (AuthZ)？&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;另一方面，授权是允许或拒绝访问应用程序内的资源的行为。它通常在身份验证之后进行，并建立经过身份验证的用户被授予访问权限的资源和权限。授权本质上回答了一个问题：“你可以做什么？”。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;授权对于确保用户在应用程序内拥有适当的访问权限至关重要，它通过保证只有拥有所需权限的人才能访问特定信息来实现这一点。实施授权有助于全面保护您的应用程序免受潜在安全风险。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;应用程序可以通过多种方式处理授权，仅举两种：&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol类=“wp-block-list”&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;基于角色的访问控制 (RBAC)：在这种情况下，根据用户在组织中的职位向用户授予权限。访问权限与特定角色相关联，因此您可以想象这样一种情况：普通用户位置可能仅具有有限的访问权限，而管理员可能拥有对所有资源的完全访问权限。使用这种授权方法可以使用户只能访问其角色所需的信息，同时简化管理。&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;基于属性的访问控制 (ABAC)：在此方法中，根据策略和属性授予访问权限。用户属性（例如部门和职位）、资源属性和环境属性（例如访问时间）都可以被视为属性。 ABAC 为您提供了一种灵活的方式来处理授权，因为所做的决策是基于策略和属性的组合，因此为您提供了更高级别的控制。&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;AuthN 与 AuthZ：主要区别以及它们如何协同工作&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;验证与权限：&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;如前所述，身份验证和授权在安全系统内具有不同的功能。身份验证用于确认用户或进程的身份。将其视为通过出示身份证件在门口验证自己身份的一种方式。而授权则侧重于保证特定用户进入后拥有特定的权限。将其视为允许您根据您的职位访问特定位置或资源的钥匙卡。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;顺序过程：&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;身份验证始终先于授权。您可以将其视为一个两步过程，其中身份验证始终是第一位的。系统始终必须验证谁进入，然后才能确定这些经过验证的用户进入后可以做什么。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;集成安全方法：&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;尽管存在差异，但他们合作得很好。您可以将它们视为同一枚硬币的两面：身份验证确保只有有效的用户才能访问该程序，而授权则确保这些用户只能访问他们被授权的资源。这是双方团队的共同努力，确保整个应用程序的安全不受影响。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;真实场景&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;我们以 Twitter 为例。在登录 Twitter 帐户之前，您必须提供您的用户名和密码。那就是认证；您向 Twitter 证明您拥有该帐户，并且 Twitter 确保只有您可以访问该帐户。登录后，您可以发送推文、更改个人资料、查看、点赞和评论其他用户的推文。但是，您无法更改或删除其他人的帐户或推文。您有权管理自己的内容并与他人互动，但无法控制其他人的帐户或执行分配给 Twitter 员工的管理任务。这就是行动中的授权。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;为什么选择正确的授权解决方案很重要&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;可扩展性和灵活性：&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;在授权方面，拥有可扩展且灵活的解决方案非常重要。您希望您的授权系统能够随着应用程序的增长而扩展以适应传入流量。可扩展的授权解决方案可以处理越来越多的用户和权限，而不会影响性能。灵活性同样重要，因为它允许您随着应用程序需求的变化轻松调整权限和角色。两者都能确保您的系统无论增长多少都保持高效。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;安全最佳实践：&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;拥有有效的授权系统是维护应用程序安全性的重要组成部分。良好的授权设置可以防止未经授权的访问敏感数据。通过确保只有具有正确权限的用户才能访问某些资源，您可以显着降低安全漏洞的风险。这不仅可以保护您的应用程序，还可以与您的用户建立信任。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;外包复杂性：&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;开发团队通常倾向于实施自己的内部授权解决方案，认为这是一个“容易解决”的问题。然而，随着应用程序的用户群和复杂性不断增长，这些自行开发的解决方案通常需要大量的维护和扩展工作。授权即服务解决方案通过将责任从开发团队转移到已经提供必要灵活性和可扩展性的成品来应对这一挑战。这种方法使团队能够专注于核心应用程序功能，同时受益于强大的、专业维护的授权系统。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;结论&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;我们在本文中介绍了很多内容，深入探讨了身份验证和授权的世界。到目前为止，您应该充分了解这两个概念的不同之处以及为什么它们对于确保应用程序安全都至关重要。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;回顾一下，身份验证就是验证您的身份。另一方面，授权是指你进入后可以做什么。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;因此，如果您希望将应用程序的安全性提升到一个新的水平，我强烈建议您查看 Cerbos。他们有大量的资源，甚至还有可供您探索的演示。相信我，您的应用程序（和您的用户）会为此感谢您。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;height:80px&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;wp-block-spacer is-style-80-120&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>【Cloud Native Glossary — the Turkish version is live! (blog in English + Turkish)】云原生术语表 — 土耳其语版本已上线！ （英语+土耳其语博客）</title>
      <link>https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/07/18/cloud-native-glossary-the-turkish-version-is-live-blog-in-english-turkish/</link>
      <description>【&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://glossary.cncf.io/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cloud Native Glossary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a project led by the CNCF Business Value Subcommittee. Its goal is to explain cloud native concepts in clear and simple language without requiring any previous technical knowledge. We are in the process of localizing the English version of the Glossary into as many languages as possible. This week we focus on Turkish and the team that localized the Glossary for Turkish speakers!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;About Turkish and the Turkish Glossary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turkish is spoken by 100 million speakers and is the most widely spoken language of the Turkic language family that is spoken by 200 million speakers world wide. Turkish is native to Türkiye, Azerbaijan, Northern Cyprus and smaller groups in Europe, Caucasus and Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has a different word order than English and many other languages: subject-object-verb. This makes translation from English a bit difficult. However, our team had numerous contributors over the past 8 months and we were able to localize over 20 pages of Cloud Native Glossary to Turkish!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Why do you think localizing the Glossary in Turkish is important?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Native Glossary is a goldmine of knowledge, but language barriers can limit its reach. The Turkish localization team is tackling this challenge by creating a standardized Turkish glossary. Our initiative brings benefits of establishing a common language for the Turkish cloud-native community and promoting a wider adoption of these technologies by making them more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Turkish localization initiative even serves as a gateway to open-source contribution by providing a user-friendly entry point for those interested in getting involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Meet the Turkish Glossary team&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliok/&#34;&gt;Ali Ok&lt;/a&gt;: Ali is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat where he works on the Knative project at CNCF.

Its goal is to explain cloud native concepts in clear and simple language without requiring any previous technical knowledge. We are in the process of localizing the English version of the Glossary into as many languages as possible. This week we focus on Turkish and the team that localized the Glossary for Turkish speakers!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;About Turkish and the Turkish Glossary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turkish is spoken by 100 million speakers and is the most widely spoken language of the Turkic language family that is spoken by 200 million speakers world wide. Turkish is native to Türkiye, Azerbaijan, Northern Cyprus and smaller groups in Europe, Caucasus and Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has a different word order than English and many other languages: subject-object-verb. This makes translation from English a bit difficult. However, our team had numerous contributors over the past 8 months and we were able to localize over 20 pages of Cloud Native Glossary to Turkish!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Why do you think localizing the Glossary in Turkish is important?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Native Glossary is a goldmine of knowledge, but language barriers can limit its reach. The Turkish localization team is tackling this challenge by creating a standardized Turkish glossary. Our initiative brings benefits of establishing a common language for the Turkish cloud-native community and promoting a wider adoption of these technologies by making them more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Turkish localization initiative even serves as a gateway to open-source contribution by providing a user-friendly entry point for those interested in getting involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Meet the Turkish Glossary team&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliok/&#34;&gt;Ali Ok&lt;/a&gt;: Ali is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat where he works on the Knative project at CNCF.

Why is it important to you?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We believe in doing our part to make the world better, one code change at a time. That’s why we’re translating the Glossary into Turkish. It’s all about making cloud-native technology easier to understand for Turkish speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of us love to see our work being used by people everywhere. Others enjoy the chance to meet and connect with new friends around the world. But what really drives us is the chance to bring everyone’s ideas together and make sure the Turkish translations are top-notch. We’re here to help future Turkish contributors get started, and that’s a big deal to us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, we’re more than just translating words; we’re creating connections and opening up a world of possibilities for Turkish speakers in the tech community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;How has the experience been?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The experience of localizing the Cloud Native Glossary in Turkish has been a journey of both challenge and reward. While there’s certainly been hard work ensuring accurate translations, the true reward lies in connecting with the broader open-source community. We’ve had the pleasure of collaborating with fellow contributors, teaching the intricacies of open-source workflows to new recruits, and providing valuable insights into the world of open-source development.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Any lessons learned you’d like to share with the community?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining open communication through channels like Slack and weekly meetings has proven essential for staying aligned with project goals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having ongoing and predefined tasks readily available facilitates any contribution process, making it more accessible for newcomers and ensuring a smoother project flow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, treating this work like a regular program in a software company and setting up processes and regular syncs is the key!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;How and why should others contribute&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We found that engaging with like-minded peers is very enjoyable.

Bu, İngilizceden çeviriyi biraz zorlaştırdı. Ancak, ekibimiz son 8 ayda birçok üyenin katkısıyla Cloud Native Sözlüğü’nün 20’den fazla sayfasını Türkçeye yerelleştirmeyi başardı!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Neden Sözlüğü Türkçeye Yerelleştirmenin Önemli Olduğunu Düşünüyorsunuz?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Native Sözlüğü, bir bilgi hazinesi, ancak dil engeli var. Türkçe yerelleştirme ekibi olarak, standart bir Türkçe sözlüğü oluşturarak bu zorluğun üstesinden gelmeye çalışıyoruz. Çabalarımızın, Türk cloud native topluluğu için ortak bir dil oluşturmanın faydalarını sağladığını ve bu teknolojilerin daha geniş bir şekilde benimsenmesini teşvik ederek onları daha erişilebilir hale getirdiğini düşünüyoruz.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ayrıca, Türkçe yerelleştirme çabamız, açık kaynak katkısına giriş için kolay bir başlangıç noktası sağlayarak ilgilenenler için bir geçiş noktası görevi de görüyor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Türkçe Sözlük ekibi&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliok/&#34;&gt;Ali Ok&lt;/a&gt;: Red Hat’te Principal Software Engineer olarak Knative projesi üzerinde çalışıyor.

The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sdgcompass.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UN’s Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;further push organizations to create sustainable products and services by 2030. With IT waste for the average enterprise reaching up to 45%,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;the importance of sustainable digital solutions in optimizing profits and protecting the environment is clear&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will explore the connections between GreenOps and FinOps, showing how integrating these methodologies can help organizations achieve business goals while managing their environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;A brief introduction to GreenOps&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GreenOps represents a holistic approach that combines business practices and technological innovations to improve cloud efficiency while reducing environmental impact&lt;/strong&gt;. This model encompasses all efforts an organization undertakes to lower the environmental footprint of their cloud operations. It involves formulating strategies that enhance sustainability and align with business goals, such as reducing waste, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and promoting a culture of environmental responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within the GreenOps operational model, organizations may adopt a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/carbon-awareness/#spatial-shifting&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;spatial-shift&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;strategy to relocate resources to regions that leverage renewable energy, thus cutting down their carbon emissions. Practices such as deactivating resources during non-peak hours can conserve energy and reduce operational expenses. Additionally, creating energy-efficient frameworks for workloads ensures optimal use of resources, maximizing performance while minimizing waste.&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, GreenOps advocates for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;continuous monitoring and optimization of cloud resources to discover additional improvement opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;. This could include adopting more energy-efficient hardware, optimizing software to lower energy consumption, and utilizing advanced analytics to forecast and manage energy usage more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GreenOps also emphasizes integrating sustainability goals into the company’s core values and daily operations. This involves educating employees on best practices for sustainable cloud usage, fostering innovation in green technologies, and regularly evaluating and reporting on the company’s environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By implementing GreenOps, organizations can achieve a dual advantage:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;driving business growth and profitability while contributing to environmental conservation&lt;/strong&gt;. This approach helps meet regulatory requirements and customer expectations for sustainability, and positions the company as a leader in corporate social responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;FinOps in a nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FinOps represents a strategic shift that integrates technology, finance, and business practices to enhance efficiency and optimize the financial performance of cloud computing infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that cloud computing constitutes a significant operational expense for many companies, a growing number of businesses are adopting FinOps. By promoting shared responsibility for cloud costs, companies can gain a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;comprehensive understanding of their cloud expenditure&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling them to optimize these costs, maximize profits, and enhance their competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.finops.org/introduction/what-is-finops/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FinOps Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;describes the concept as an evolving cloud financial management discipline and cultural practice that enables organizations to achieve maximum business value by helping engineering, finance, technology, and business teams collaborate on data-driven spending decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In essence,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;FinOps refers to a discipline and cultural mindset that encourages collaboration between different departments within an organization to optimize IT spending&lt;/strong&gt;. The primary teams involved in FinOps are the Finance department and DevOps teams. This cross-functional dialogue aims to maximize the value derived from cloud services by balancing speed, cost, and quality, while carefully considering the impact of cloud expenditures on the overall results. In FinOps, every decision regarding cloud spending is evaluated through a data-driven decision-making process,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;focusing on optimization, cost forecasting, and cost allocation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;By adopting FinOps, organizations not only streamline their cloud financial management but also cultivate a culture of transparency and collaboration, leading to better financial outcomes and enhanced business value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;What’s the synergy between GreenOps and FinOps?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although FinOps and GreenOps are distinct approaches, they work together seamlessly to help companies optimize their cloud usage and costs while also reducing their environmental footprint. By integrating these two strategies, businesses can achieve both financial efficiency and sustainability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;FinOps is a key component of GreenOps&lt;/strong&gt;. By ensuring optimal use of cloud resources, companies not only save costs but also reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, making it a win-win situation. This synergy makes FinOps an essential framework for companies aiming to enhance their sustainability efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While FinOps focuses on monitoring IT spending and cloud-related expenses, GreenOps tracks the carbon footprint of the infrastructure, whether it’s entirely cloud-based or a hybrid model&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite their different goals, the two methodologies are interconnected, especially in full cloud environments, with a shared aim of optimizing cloud resources through proper dimensioning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a more powerful virtual machine instance not only costs more but also demands more power, resulting in higher emissions. This correlation highlights the need to integrate FinOps and GreenOps to balance costs, emissions, and power requirements effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a high-level perspective, GreenOps and FinOps appear quite similar, sharing the ultimate goal of efficient cloud usage. Achieving maximum efficiency leads to two main outcomes:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;reduced costs and lower carbon emissions&lt;/strong&gt;. The same FinOps practices, such as right-sizing, storage tiering, removing idle and unattached resources, and scheduling compute off times, are also applied in GreenOps to reduce carbon emissions. In his closing remarks at AWS re:Invent,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forrester.com/blogs/aws-silent-nod-to-finops/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Werner Vogels&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;highlighted this connection by stating that cost is a close proxy for sustainability, affirming the tightly integrated relationship between FinOps and GreenOps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By understanding and implementing both FinOps and GreenOps, organizations can better manage their cloud resources, cutting costs while also minimizing their environmental impact. This dual approach not only meets regulatory and customer expectations for sustainability but also positions companies as leaders in corporate social responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Put the theory into practice: a real-world scenario&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a scenario where all environments typically used in a software delivery pipeline —development, staging, and production—operate with the same number of pods on an identical infrastructure, each with overlapping computational demands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;By keeping development and staging environments active outside working hours, we end up using unnecessary resources for 128 out of the 168 hours in a week. This translates to roughly 103% more usage than necessary&lt;/strong&gt;. In practical terms, engineers use these environments only about 23% of the time, highlighting the significant resource wastage in many engineering companies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, addressing this inefficiency is straightforward. With a few configuration lines and the installation of a Kubernetes operator called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kube-green.dev/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;kube‑green&lt;/a&gt;, we can drastically reduce resource wastage. Kube-green is an add-on for Kubernetes that automates the shutdown of unnecessary resources and restarts them as needed, using a simple configuration known as CRD SleepInfo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider a cluster managing 75 namespaces, where we aim to suspend 48 namespaces outside working hours (our development and staging environments) while keeping deployments named api-gateway active. Without kube-green, this cluster runs about 1050 pods, with 75 GB of memory and 45 CPUs allocated, and consumes 45 GB of memory and 4.5 CPUs. This usage results in approximately 222 kg of CO2 emissions per week.&lt;br&gt;By configuring SleepInfo with kube-green, we can reduce the total pod count by 600, bringing it down to 450. Allocated resources drop to 30 GB of memory and 15 CPUs. Actual resource consumption decreases to 21 GB of memory and 1 CPU,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;lowering emissions to about 139 kg of CO2 per week&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using kube-green on this cluster for a week reduces CO2 emissions by 83 kg, a 38% decrease compared to normal operations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Over a year, this translates to a reduction of approximately 4000 kg of CO2&lt;/strong&gt;. This not only benefits the environment but also results in significant cost savings. Most cloud providers charge based on the number of nodes used, so reducing node count during off-hours lowers operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-table&#34;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Without kube‑green&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;With kube‑green&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Difference&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;CPU consumed [cpu]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;CPU allocated [cpu]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;CO2eq/week [kg]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;222&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;139&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;83&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Implementing kube-green offers a dual advantage: environmental sustainability and financial savings. By optimizing resource usage and reducing emissions, companies can achieve a more efficient and cost-effective cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adopting FinOps practices alongside GreenOps allows us to use cost as a driver for GreenOps implementation, aligning business benefits with environmental advantages. With tools like kube-green, we can integrate our GreenOps strategy seamlessly into our existing workload management, achieving positive impacts on both infrastructure costs and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GreenOps and FinOps are closely intertwined concepts. Often,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;when we optimize resources from a sustainability standpoint, we also realize savings on our cloud expenses&lt;/strong&gt;. To make well-informed decisions, it’s crucial to have visibility into both the costs of our clusters and their CO2eq emissions. Many cost monitoring tools, like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opencost.io/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenCost&lt;/a&gt;, now include carbon cost emissions tracking in addition to tracking cloud spending.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By leveraging FinOps and GreenOps together, we can enhance our operational efficiency and reduce our environmental footprint without significant changes to how we manage workloads&lt;/strong&gt;. Tools such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kube-green.dev/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;kube-green&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;enable automatic scaling down of resources during off-peak hours, ensuring we only use what is necessary. This not only minimizes energy consumption and emissions but also translates into substantial cost savings, as most cloud service providers charge based on resource usage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having insight into both financial and environmental metrics empowers organizations to make data-driven decisions that benefit both the bottom line and the planet. Monitoring tools that provide comprehensive views of both cost and carbon emissions help businesses balance efficiency with sustainability, reinforcing the symbiotic relationship between FinOps and GreenOps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In essence,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;combining FinOps with GreenOps helps us create a more sustainable and cost-effective cloud infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;, driving business success while promoting environmental responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/castograziano/&#34;

rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gartner&lt;/a&gt; 预测，在未来两年内，75% 的组织将取代缺乏可持续发展目标和时间表的供应商。 &lt;a href=&#34;https://sdgcompass.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;联合国可持续发展目标&lt;/a&gt;进一步推动各组织到 2030 年打造可持续产品和服务。对于达到 45% 的普通企业来说，&lt;strong&gt;可持续数字解决方案在优化利润和保护环境方面的重要性是显而易见的&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;在本文中，我们将探讨 GreenOps 和 FinOps 之间的联系，展示整合这些方法如何帮助组织实现业务目标，同时管理其环境影响。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;GreenOps 简介&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GreenOps 代表了一种将业务实践与技术创新相结合的整体方法，可提高云效率，同时减少对环境的影响&lt;/strong&gt;。该模型涵盖了组织为降低云运营的环境足迹而做出的所有努力。它涉及制定增强可持续性并与业务目标保持一致的战略，例如减少浪费、转向可再生能源以及促进环境责任文化。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;在 GreenOps 运营模型中，组织可以采用&lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/carbon-awareness/#spatial-shifting&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;空间-转变战略，将资源重新分配到利用可再生能源的地区，从而减少碳排放。在非高峰时段停用资源等做法可以节省能源并降低运营费用。此外，为工作负载创建节能框架可确保资源的最佳利用，最大限度地提高性能，同时最大限度地减少浪费。&lt;br&gt;此外，GreenOps 提倡&lt;strong&gt;持续监控和优化云资源，以发现更多改进机会&lt;/strong&gt;。这可能包括采用更节能的硬件、优化软件以降低能耗，以及利用高级分析来更有效地预测和管理能源使用情况。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GreenOps 还强调将可持续发展目标融入公司的核心价值观和日常运营中。这包括对员工进行可持续云使用最佳实践的教育，促进绿色技术创新，以及定期评估和报告公司的环境影响。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;通过实施 GreenOps，组织可以实现双重优势：&lt;strong&gt;推动业务增长和盈利能力，同时为环境保护做出贡献&lt;/strong&gt;。这种方法有助于满足监管要求和客户对可持续发展的期望，并使公司成为企业社会责任方面的领导者。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;FinOps 简而言之&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FinOps 代表了一种战略转变，它将技术、财务和业务实践相结合，以提高效率并优化云计算基础设施的财务绩效&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;鉴于云计算对许多公司来说构成了巨大的运营支出，越来越多的企业正在采用 FinOps。通过促进云成本的共担责任，公司可以&lt;strong&gt;全面了解其云支出&lt;/strong&gt;，从而优化这些成本、实现利润最大化并增强竞争优势。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.finops.org/introduction/what-is-finops/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FinOps 基金会&lt;/a&gt;将这一概念描述为不断发展的云财务管理学科和文化实践，使组织能够通过帮助工程、财务、技术和业务团队协作制定数据驱动的支出决策来实现最大的业务价值。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;本质上，&lt;strong&gt;FinOps 指的是一种纪律和文化心态，鼓励组织内不同部门之间的协作以优化 IT 支出&lt;/strong&gt;。参与 FinOps 的主要团队是财务部门和 DevOps 团队。这种跨职能对话旨在通过平衡速度、成本和质量来最大化云服务的价值，同时仔细考虑云支出对整体结果的影响。在 FinOps 中，有关云支出的每一项决策都会通过数据驱动的决策流程进行评估，&lt;strong&gt;重点关注优化、成本预测和成本分配&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;br&gt;通过采用 FinOps，组织不仅可以简化其业务流程云财务管理，还培养透明度和协作文化，从而实现更好的财务成果并提高业务价值。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;GreenOps 和 FinOps 之间的协同作用是什么？&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;虽然 FinOps 和 GreenOps 是不同的方法，但它们无缝协作，帮助公司优化云使用和成本，同时减少环境足迹。通过整合这两种策略，企业可以实现财务效率和可持续性。 &lt;strong&gt;FinOps 是 GreenOps 的关键组成部分&lt;/strong&gt;。通过确保云资源的最佳利用，企业不仅可以节省成本，还可以减少能源消耗和碳排放，实现双赢。这种协同作用使 FinOps 成为旨在加强可持续发展努力的公司的重要框架。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FinOps 专注于监控 IT 支出和云相关费用，而 GreenOps 则跟踪基础设施的碳足迹，无论是完全基于云还是混合模型&lt;/strong&gt;。尽管目标不同，但这两种方法是相互关联的，尤其是在完整的云环境中，其共同目标是通过适当的规模优化云资源。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;例如，功能更强大的虚拟机实例不仅成本更高，而且需要更多电力，从而导致更高的排放。这种相关性凸显了整合 FinOps 和 GreenOps 的必要性，以有效平衡成本、排放和电力需求。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;从高层角度来看，GreenOps 和 FinOps 看起来非常相似，都拥有高效云使用的最终目标。实现最高效率可带来两个主要成果：&lt;strong&gt;降低成本和减少碳排放&lt;/strong&gt;。相同的 FinOps 实践（例如调整规模、存储分层、删除闲置和未连接的资源以及安排计算关闭时间）也适用于 GreenOps，以减少碳排放。在 AWS re:Invent 的闭幕词中，&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forrester.com/blogs/aws-silent-nod-to-finops/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; Werner Vogels&lt;/a&gt;强调了这种联系，指出成本是可持续性的密切代表，肯定了 FinOps 和 GreenOps 之间紧密结合的关系。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;通过了解和实施 FinOps 和 GreenOps，组织可以更好地管理其云资源、削减成本，同时最大限度地减少对环境的影响。这种双重方法不仅满足监管和客户对可持续发展的期望，而且使公司成为企业社会责任的领导者。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;将理论付诸实践：现实场景&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;想象一个场景，软件交付管道中通常使用的所有环境（开发、登台和生产）都在相同的基础设施上使用相同数量的 Pod 运行，每个 Pod 都有重叠的计算需求。 &lt;strong&gt;通过在工作时间之外保持开发和暂存环境处于活动状态，我们最终在每周 168 个小时中的 128 个小时中使用了不必要的资源。这意味着使用量比必要的多了大约 103%&lt;/strong&gt;。实际上，工程师只有大约 23% 的时间使用这些环境，这凸显了许多工程公司的严重资源浪费。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;幸运的是，解决这种效率低下的问题很简单。通过几行配置并安装名为 &lt;a href=&#34;https://kube-green.dev/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;kube‑green&lt;/a&gt; 的 Kubernetes Operator，我们可以大大减少资源浪费。 Kube-green 是 Kubernetes 的一个附加组件，它使用称为 CRD SleepInfo 的简单配置自动关闭不必要的资源并根据需要重新启动它们。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;考虑一个管理 75 个命名空间的集群，我们的目标是在工作时间之外暂停 48 个命名空间（我们的开发和临时环境），同时保持名为 api-gateway 的部署处于活动状态。如果没有 kube-green，该集群运行大约 1050 个 Pod，分配 75 GB 内存和 45 个 CPU，消耗 45 GB 内存和 4.5 个 CPU。这种使用情况每周会产生约 222 公斤的二氧化碳排放量。&lt;br&gt;通过使用 kube-green 配置 SleepInfo，我们可以将 pod 总数减少 600 个，使其减少到 450 个。分配的资源减少到 30 GB 内存和 15 GB CPU。实际资源消耗减少至 21 GB 内存和 1 个 CPU，&lt;strong&gt;每周二氧化碳排放量减少至约 139 公斤&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;在该集群上使用 kube-green 一周，二氧化碳排放量减少了 83 公斤，与正常运行相比减少了 38%。 &lt;strong&gt;一年多以来，这相当于减少了约 4000 公斤二氧化碳&lt;/strong&gt;。这不仅有利于环境，还可以显着节省成本。大多数云提供商根据使用的节点数量收费，因此在非工作时间减少节点数量可以降低运营成本。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-table&#34;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;不使用 kube-green&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;使用 kube-green&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;差异&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;CPU消耗[cpu]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;CPU分配[cpu]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td &gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;二氧化碳当量/周[千克]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;222&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;139&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;83&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt; /tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;实施 kube-green 具有双重优势：环境可持续性和财务节省。通过优化资源使用和减少排放，企业可以实现更高效、更具成本效益的云基础设施。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;总结&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;将 FinOps 实践与 GreenOps 一起采用，使我们能够利用成本作为 GreenOps 实施的驱动力，使业务效益与环境优势保持一致。借助 kube-green 等工具，我们可以将 GreenOps 策略无缝集成到现有的工作负载管理中，从而对基础设施成本和可持续性产生积极影响。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GreenOps 和 FinOps 是紧密相连的概念。通常，&lt;strong&gt;当我们从可持续发展的角度优化资源时，我们还会节省云费用&lt;/strong&gt;。为了做出明智的决策，了解集群的成本及其二氧化碳当量排放量至关重要。许多成本监控工具（例如 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opencost.io/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenCost&lt;/a&gt;）现在除了跟踪碳成本排放量之外，还包括碳成本排放跟踪云支出。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;通过结合利用 FinOps 和 GreenOps，我们可以提高运营效率并减少环境足迹，而无需对工作负载管理方式进行重大改变&lt;/strong&gt;。 &lt;a href=&#34;https://kube-green.dev/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;kube-green&lt;/a&gt; 等工具可在非高峰时段自动缩减资源，确保我们只使用必要的东西。这不仅最大限度地减少能源消耗和排放，而且还可以节省大量成本，因为大多数云服务提供商根据资源使用情况收费。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;深入了解财务和环境指标，使组织能够做出数据驱动的决策，从而造福于利润和地球。提供成本和碳排放综合视图的监控工具可帮助企业平衡效率与可持续性，加强 FinOps 和 GreenOps 之间的共生关系。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;本质上，&lt;strong&gt;将 FinOps 与 GreenOps 相结合有助于我们创建更具可持续性和成本效益的云基础设施&lt;/strong&gt;，在推动业务成功的同时促进环境责任。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/castograziano/&#34;
