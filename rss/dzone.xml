      <title>【MCP Client-Server Integration With Semantic Kernel】MCP Client-Server Integration With Semantic Kernel</title>

      <description>【&lt;p&gt;Modern AI applications gain real popularity when they translate natural language prompts to execute external services. This article describes the basic understanding of the key components: semantic kernel, Azure OpenAI, and MCP Client-Server. It also describes the implementation to connect the Semantic Kernel to an Azure-hosted OpenAI resource so that an LLM can be queried directly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you will learn how to create an &lt;a href=&#34;https://dzone.com/articles/mcp-client-agent-architecture-amp-implementation&#34;&gt;MCP Client&lt;/a&gt;, run the MCP Server, and expose the MCP tools. The tools that are discovered can then be registered as kernel functions in the Semantic Kernel and thus, augment the LLM with the ability to execute external tools as a Service that are provided through the MCP Server.&lt;/p&gt;】&lt;p&gt;Modern AI applications gain real popularity when they translate natural language prompts to execute external services.

      <description>【&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, the conversation around AI has slowly shifted from prompt engineering to something more structured and more powerful: context engineering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you are working on a chatbot that answers questions around a knowledge base or working on an agentic AI framework that is very complex, the way you architect context depends entirely on the problem you are solving. Simply put, context complexity scales with the task uncertainty. Simple, predictable tasks require minimal context structuring, while complex, multi-step tasks require sophisticated context orchestration.&lt;/p&gt;】&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, the conversation around AI has slowly shifted from prompt engineering to something more structured and more powerful: context engineering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you are working on a chatbot that answers questions around a knowledge base or working on an agentic AI framework that is very complex, the way you architect context depends entirely on the problem you are solving.
